Abe Rosloff: were you assuming Vo in the y direction was 0? i think what happens that makes this problematic is that displacement isnt being used i tried using distance instead and it worked it doesnt take into account only the up or down trip in finding the dy which i why you were right in saying that it accounted for all the time is* noice job (y) 
Michael Lu: ??? 
Abe Rosloff: basically only scalar quantities will work with what you're doing 
Michael Lu: why not vector though? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMllOEkObx8 
Abe Rosloff: lets say you have a projectile and shoot it and it goes 10m on the up trip and 10m on the down trip thats 0m dispalcement if u use distance thats 20m which is what works 
Michael Lu: because you account for direction in vectors i see But displacement isn't really final displacemen 
Abe Rosloff: no, but if you want to use the whole time then it has to be distance 
Michael Lu: The equation is just giving the y height for a given x heihgt there is no time 
Abe Rosloff: x isnt a height and i understand 
Michael Lu: x distance sry 
Abe Rosloff: but when you do that equation to eliminate t i changed it from what u had cuz i was trying dx t = dy / viy 
Michael Lu: oh okay 
Abe Rosloff: wait shit ugh i made an algebra mistake again :'( 
Michael Lu: idk i used this 
Abe Rosloff: yeah im watchin g what this guy shows in the video is also half of the total time that the projectile is in the ait air that t is just for the up trip if you were looking for the entirety of the trip it would need to be 1/2t = dx / vx 
Michael Lu: so, the equation dy = 0.5ayt^2 + vyt is just for the up trip? if it is vector? 
Abe Rosloff: could also be down trip but yeah do you know what g is? why he's using g? 
Michael Lu: g is 9.8 
Abe Rosloff: but do you know WHAT it is 
Michael Lu: acceleration of gravity thing 
Abe Rosloff: yeah right so why would it be -g as its shown in the videop 
Michael Lu: or gravitational attraction acceleration between earth and some obect he wants it to be -9.8 so he gets a negative parabola if he graphs it 
Abe Rosloff: no... forget about the equation for a second what is acceleration 
Michael Lu: m/s^2 change in velocity over time ? 
Abe Rosloff: right so if i drop a ball i dont throw it down i just drop it what is its acceleration 
Michael Lu: -9.8 m/s^2? 
Abe Rosloff: it could be but for our purposed lets assume if somethings getting faster its positive so lets call it 9.8 m/s^2 i drop it and thats how much it speed up per second now if i were to throw it up would it be getting faster or slower 
Michael Lu: it depends right? on the time 
Abe Rosloff: forget time just imagine it u throw something in the air 
Michael Lu: it decelerates going up and accelerates coming down 
Abe Rosloff: before it comes back down is it getting faster or slower right good you throw it up at whatever velocity it decelerates until speed reaches 0 now if u look as it comes back down the velocity starts at 0 and ends with the velocity you threw it up at if it took 5 seconds for it to go up and reach 0 speed whats the total time of the trip 
Michael Lu: 10 seconds? 
Abe Rosloff: right 5 sec up 5 sec down same thing applies to projectiles fire something up at a speed it decelerates (which is where our friend -g comes from) until it reaches 0 speed (not really but pretend) then it has a down trip in which it accelerates and youd use g not -g if u use -g ur finding the time for the up trip which is half the total time the object is in the air the exception being if u were doing something where the object starts high and falls then you'd use +g and that would be the total time 
Michael Lu: Hmmmmmmm 
Abe Rosloff: you can also use -g on a down trip if everything else is made negative too but no ones does that : p 
Michael Lu: i do that that is why i use -g negative velocity indicates downward direction in some conventions 
Abe Rosloff: then you're finding the down trip 
Michael Lu: it would still work for the up trip though because the negative g is deducting the value of the positive upwards velocity 
Abe Rosloff: well with his since its a parabola yeah his equation would be able to do that 
Michael Lu: that's the purpose of the equation breh 
Abe Rosloff: the normal dy = 1/2 at^2 cannot 
Michael Lu: dy = 1/2at^2 what is that for? 
Abe Rosloff: also projectiles 
Michael Lu: is that just for dropping a thing 
Abe Rosloff: nope well kinda it can be used for the up trip or down trip not both the time it yields has to be doubled 
Michael Lu: how does one use it for the up trip 
Abe Rosloff: unlike that guys equation Vo = 10 viy = 5 
Michael Lu: but there is no velocity in that equation 
Abe Rosloff: ik ik patience michael so if theta is 30 viy is 5 yay now theres another equation to learn woohoo! vf = vi + 2ad vf^2 = vi^2 +2ad* 
Michael Lu: ja that one 
Abe Rosloff: so using that u find dy now this is important u can only do the up trip or down trip with this equation so if we do the up trip wait how do u like to treat g based on acceleration or direction i do it by acceleration or deceleration 
Michael Lu: what does that mean 
Abe Rosloff: but some like to do it based on moving down or up like do u prefer to use -g when its decelerating or moving down 
Michael Lu: I use -g all the time maybe 
Abe Rosloff: alrighty so that works 0^2 = 25 + 2(-9.8)(d) -25 = 2(-9.8)d d = .64 so now u have dy = .64 back to that inital equation dy = vit +1/2at^2 with this you HAVE to choose either up trip or down trip 
Michael Lu: why 
Abe Rosloff: because dy is the height the object reaches at its peak if the up trip and the distance it falls if the down trip 
Michael Lu: so, isn't that just the vertex of the parabola? 
Abe Rosloff: yes 
Michael Lu: so why do they use that equation isn't k = (4ac - b^2)/4a 
Abe Rosloff: its just a simplified equation its quick 
Michael Lu: k = (4ac - b^2)/4a how does that become dy = vit +1/2at^2 
Abe Rosloff: tbh i have no idea ive never sat down and derived it 
Michael Lu: okay... 
Abe Rosloff: sorry but yeah thats an equation where u have to choose up or down 
Michael Lu: really? I never chose up or down when I used it 
Abe Rosloff: the dy = vit + 1/2at^2 yeah because u were using that guys equation which is nice and doesnt make you because its formatted to be a parabola and allows you to find the position 
Michael Lu: dy = vit + 1/2at^2 is a parabola too 
Abe Rosloff: sigh im having trouble explaining it i guess with the other equation you were finding a specific position of a point you're not looking for location with this one i mean i guess you could whatever the point is no pun intended when this equation is used you only get half the time of the total trip and the full time of either the up or down trip assuming you know what dy is 
Michael Lu: yes I gotta sleeeep now bye We will continue this later 
Abe Rosloff: alrighty lol 
Michael Lu: Bye abbbeeeee 
Abe Rosloff: sorry its hard to explain on fb and cya

Abe Rosloff: you need to know calc but oh yeah thats it maxwells equation it has to do with light 
Michael Lu: ja 
Abe Rosloff: rank one tensor is fancy talk for a vector second rank is fancy talk for a matrix 
Michael Lu: what be a matrix 
Abe Rosloff: its simply a way of plotting data but it has usages like solving systems of equationsd 
Michael Lu: i remember i see 
Abe Rosloff: mhm 
Michael Lu: mr dickson taught it 
Abe Rosloff: coolio 
Michael Lu: i no idea what it is 
Abe Rosloff: well there are rules that govern multiplication and other things that make them very handy 
Michael Lu: okay so michio kaku is saying a four dimensional "diversion" matrix = 0? what is a four dimensional diversion? 
Abe Rosloff: i dont remember all that well but i THINK a diversion is something that negates a tensor so like it would negate the matrix 
Michael Lu: negate? 
Abe Rosloff: and then the 4d thing is just talking about electromagnetic fields like cancel out 
Michael Lu: oh ok 
Abe Rosloff: i dont remember but i think thats it im no particle or quantum physicist : p 
Michael Lu: okay 
Abe Rosloff: wait actually er thats not it one sec ill look it up ok yeah divergence is what bring a 2nd rank to a first rank 
Michael Lu: wadaheck' 
Abe Rosloff: matrix to a vector basically what this quote is saying is that 
Michael Lu: oh okay 
Abe Rosloff: in the beginning there was nothing then there was light cuz quantum stuff that i dont understand dictates that the vector for light is = 0 in a perfect vacuum until charge comes along i dont really know what it means in terms of the vector cuz idk quantum but hes saying then there was lighjt 
Michael Lu: okay 
Abe Rosloff: light* feel free to ask other questions (maybe less quantum-y) and ill answer after dinner (y)

Michael Lu: bad things happen 
Abe Rosloff: cmon lulu what do u think happens 
Michael Lu: yur tissues and liquids go out of your body then you freeze and get roasted by the sun idk 
Abe Rosloff: lol the first one is kinda right the pressure difference lowers the pressure in ur body extremely when pressur edecreases so does boiling point so ur saliva and other fluids begin to boil 
Michael Lu: that's nic 
Abe Rosloff: because space makes the boiling point of water 37 degrees celsius yeah totally BUT you cant freeze becasue theres no where for heat to flow and you dont explode because ur body's good at not exploding ALSO if u cnan get ur helmet back on fast enough u live! woohoo!

Conversation:
Abe Rosloff: in case u want to apply ur physics knowledge to something 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Abe, why does the piano go the same distance as the golf ball? 
Abe Rosloff: in what projectiles? because mass has nothing to do with it if ur in a world with friction and what not and even then it can still be a minor difference look at ur projectile equations what could mass have to do with any of them? Sorry that wasn't a very good explanation before Basically horizontal velocity is horizontal velocity regardless of the object, same with initial velocity all together Now the other thing is that although the piano is heavier, and therefore the force acting down (fg) is greater, the acceleration due to gravity is always the same Now in order to achieve the same initial velocity more force would have to allied to the piano If you applied the same force with the cannon to both objects they would not go the same distance But with same angle and same initial velocity They'll always go the same distance 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: I thought that the piano has more inertia, so it will fly less from the same cannon impact that will affect a golf ball 
Abe Rosloff: no but thats what im saying the impacts arent the same the force to shoot the piano is much greater it has to be BECAUSE of the mass and inertia 


Conversation:
Abe Rosloff: hey lulu, so another thing about mass and falling if i take a bowling ball and a ping pong ball and drop them off a building at the same time from the same height which will hit the ground first 
Michael Lu: land at same time disregarding air resistance 
Abe Rosloff: yep why 
Michael Lu: because 9.8 m/s^2 earth pulls on heavier object more but it has greater mass? greater force/greater mass = 9.8 likewise smaller force/smaller mass = 9.8 
Abe Rosloff: well i guess thats a way to think about it yeah everything falling will accelerate at 9.8m/s^2 because thats just how gravity works so itll have to be the same speed the best way to prove it is really through the potential and kinetic energy equations do u know those? btw with what you said fg/m will always be 9.8 on earth because fg = mg 
Michael Lu: Kinetic = 0.5mv^2 idk potential m*g*h? for gravitational? 
Abe Rosloff: yeah so mgh always has to equal 1/2mv^2 not in real life but pretend friction doesnt exist 
Michael Lu: ok 
Abe Rosloff: so when the ball isnt moving and is at the top of the building what form of energy do the balls have and how much of each 
Michael Lu: gpe heavier has more GPE 
Abe Rosloff: ew dont say gpe Usp is how u say it but just say pe 
Michael Lu: what is usp? 
Abe Rosloff: wait no sorry usp is spring potential nvm U means energy so jsut say pe for now gpe looks weird :p anyway yeah its all pe so lets say one ball is two kg and the other is 1 kg and they're both 10m in the air so 1 x 10 x 10 and 2 x 10 x 10 gives u the pes 100 and 200 so if the kes have to give u 100 and 200 1/2(1)(v^2) = 100 1/2(2)(V^2) =200 the speed of the first one is what 
Michael Lu: hold on abe, i gotta fix a zipper 
Abe Rosloff: good luck lulue godspeed 
Michael Lu: thx 
Abe Rosloff: spoiler the first one has a v of 40 as 100/.5 = 200 and sqr(200) = 40 for the second, 200/1 = 200 sqr(200) is 40 they both have the same speed they both land at the same tinme time*

Michael Lu: vely vely cheeeeep 
Abe Rosloff: that graphics card is gonna fry 
Michael Lu: the graphcis card has a fan on it though

Michael Lu: ise 
Abe Rosloff: those fans wont be enough 
Michael Lu: lelelelel 
Abe Rosloff: how many case fans 
Michael Lu: 1 
Abe Rosloff: oof alright maybe its like the little graphics card that could 
Michael Lu: lemme feel it to see how hot hot hot it is 
Abe Rosloff: discharge ur hand first its dry turn off the computer too 
Michael Lu: lelelelelellelleelle idk i felt the case\ dog 
Abe Rosloff: yeah that wont do it whatever should be fine jsut test it if u play any graphcis intensive things 
Michael Lu: none of me games are that intense lel i run wot on minimal settings at 7 fps on me laptop so anything better than that is satisfying and me internet is not that great either i'm using a usb for wifi huihuihuihui 
Abe Rosloff: why not get a wifi card

Lulu, being Emma's brother did play a big role in why I started talking to you, and why I would joke around with you, but I really do like YOU and enjoy YOUR company. Whether it was laughing at Brian, or talking about physics, or me beating whatever traces of innocence you had left in you to death, you always managed to make me laugh. Once in a while you'd bug me like when I didn't like how you acted towards that kid on the bus, but at the end of the day I'm an asshole so who am I to judge!? :D You're a good kid lulu, i wish you all the best, and im sorry you havent signed my yearbook yet, we'll make it happen dont you worry. stay you lulu, and remember not to have too much sex.

Conversation:
Michael Lu: papa abe\ what's a windows free simple editing software that can play 4 or more videos at the same time (split screen for music cover) 
Abe Rosloff: Pirate premier 
Michael Lu: wut 
Abe Rosloff: Sigh When do you need it 
Michael Lu: not soon btw how do you deal with latency 
Abe Rosloff: In what sense 
Michael Lu: i recorded each part but there was a delay between pressing the record button and the start so if i play all the videos at the same time the parts don't sync because of that delay 
Abe Rosloff: With premier you can use waveform sync but other than that unless the cameras used special time codes you'll have to do it by sound 
Michael Lu: what's wafeform sync so it only syncs audio? 
Abe Rosloff: Are the audio and video recorded separately 
Michael Lu: nope 
Abe Rosloff: Then they'd be joined together Syncing up the audio would sync up the video 
Michael Lu: err i mean that the audio between separate videos is not synced 
Abe Rosloff: I know what you're saying 
Michael Lu: so does premier fix that? 
Abe Rosloff: Your ear can fix that But yes sometimes 
Michael Lu: okaeeeee

Conversation:
Abraham Skandera: ic u ended up doing ROTC 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Idk Kinda conflicted Just finished it today Not sure whether I should pursue scholarship + officer commission Or just do college normally then enlist if I want Idk whyâd u quit 
Abraham Skandera: wait you didn't get scholarship to begin with? I mean I quit like a month after I committed 
Michael Lu: Yeah I joined this year on a whim Without scholarship 
Abraham Skandera: ohohohohoh 
Michael Lu: As a âcollege programmerâ 
Abraham Skandera: ic 
Michael Lu: Honestly 
Abraham Skandera: lmao 
Michael Lu: Like this shit is fun 
Abraham Skandera: yeha 
Michael Lu: But like with MIT it would prob be time consuming And I donât wanna sign a four year contract so soon Did u do any ROTC stuff at MIT 
Abraham Skandera: bo 
Michael Lu: or did u just immediately quit 
Abraham Skandera: no I quit like 4 months before MIT I mean I also never actually did any ROTC stuff 
Michael Lu: Dam howâd u quit 
Abraham Skandera: declined scholarship 
Michael Lu: Oh Lol 
Abraham Skandera: so advantages that I could think of(with staying): hype potentially better prep for a military career 
Michael Lu: Iâm not that big on military career th 
Abraham Skandera: I talked to a commander(who went to the academy) what he thought ohh so I mean 
Michael Lu: Iâm more like 4 years max 
Abraham Skandera: what would your reasons be? 
Michael Lu: Just for the feels the hype and the fun 
Abraham Skandera: wait but it's like a big commitment for hype and fun 
Michael Lu: Prob not doing ROTC tho 
Abraham Skandera: oh you mean ur doing like OCS 
Michael Lu: No donât even feel like going down officer path See Iâm a marine option 
Abraham Skandera: ahhhhh 
Michael Lu: And like TBS is 6 months so nah And then all the summer cruises and OCA OCS 
Abraham Skandera: so I was thnking about mil career bruh joining marines is a lot 
Michael Lu: Yeah I checked the contracts And boot camp is long as fuck Idk Iâm def not skipping college lol 
Abraham Skandera: wait plus deployment right after college 
Michael Lu: Idk Iâll prob find out what I want to do during four years in MIT I was just wondering what ur rationale was for quitting rotc/military life 
Abraham Skandera: oh yes so I felt like: *in a meeting now will get back in like a few hrs I really like a lot of aspects of military life, or at least a lot of perceived aspects of life, but I think the biggest reason I would consider joinning would be the percieved service to america Somehting I realized as I started the whole process is that I was a lot better(relative to other stuff) at being a smart little engineer than I would probably be at being an engineer *at being a soldier or a sailor cause like i'm a p solid engineer I also really wanted the flexibility that not committing to rotc allowed like I switchhed majors my first semester and interned at lockheed martin this semester I feel like ifu want to do military it 's just as easy to join after school and then you have full flex during school which is something that's v nice If the scholarship is important then i def follow ur reasons esp if ur not a sellout major (course 6 haha) 
Michael Lu: Lol yeah Iâd rather keep college open and not do rotc Thx Abe! For advice 
Abraham Skandera: don't get me wrong like massive props if u do

Michael Lu: sir have u built facebook scrapers before? 
Abraham Skandera: yes once it's tricky bc fb will ban you for scraping 
Michael Lu: How did u get around that 
Abraham Skandera: you have to delay like time out for random periods of time between requests try to make a fake account for debugging and then log into it using athena bc they'll block ur account/ip 
Michael Lu: Lol should I just use LinkedIn Scraping 
Abraham Skandera: what are you tryna get ppl info? 
Michael Lu: Yes like ppl location 
Abraham Skandera: rip this sounds annoying 
Michael Lu: How bad is the ban And how easy is it to get banned if I use proper timing functions Also how long do ur scrapers run if ur using randomized timing functions and what timing functions durations do u use 
Abraham Skandera: not super sure i wouldn't be surprised if it's Life wait google this stuff odds are it's changed i did biased gaussian delays between 3s and 15 min when i get to my laptop I'll see if i can find the code i copied and modified but like fb really doesn't like you scraping so they've prob changed their algo 
Michael Lu: Maybe I should just do linked in lol 
Abraham Skandera: wait my guess is that linked in os the same 
Michael Lu: I looked it up online I think theyâre more chill 
Abraham Skandera: oh then yes my guess is that it's also more structured bc ppl are less likely to meme around

        return I got the lmod answer from dev that's like the official answer I don't know why ours wasn't working tough 
Michael Lu: So the code u just sent 
Allen Huang: wait what the fuck 
Michael Lu: Is correct code 
Allen Huang: they renamed step to sgd_step what the fuck I think the colab and lmod were just different like if you rename it sgd_step it works 
Michael Lu: Wdym My method is already named sgd_step But this isnât in the collab 
Allen Huang: huh when I copy pasted from the colab it was named step not sgd_step for some reason and that's why I got fucked 
Michael Lu: Wait Is the code you sent The code that works for the HW 
Allen Huang: yeah 
Michael Lu: ok the mitx 
Allen Huang: it's the code that's provided when you click view answer what's different from your code oh their code makes some questionable decisions 
Michael Lu: I didnât do element wise G * Z 
Allen Huang: nice 
Michael Lu: I dot producted lol 
Allen Huang: how long have you spent on this problem 
Michael Lu: 30 min to an hour idk I just skipped ahead after Allen said he couldnât get it 
Allen Huang: lmao nice did you finish number 4 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Allen Huang: what's the code can i see 
Michael Lu: Itâs bullshit lol Iâll send 
Allen Huang: ty thx

Allen Huang: join the call pls 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: yo how much 036 have u done 
Allen Huang: lmao I got to halfway through questio n2 shit is hard 
Michael Lu: can u help 1.6 
Allen Huang: lmao you and dev both 
Michael Lu: and I'll give you question 2 oh shit dev couldn't figure it out 
Allen Huang: Wsx =    np.zeros((3,1))
Wss =    np.array([[1, -2, 3],
                   [1, 0, 0],
                   [0, 1, 0]])
Wo =     np.array([[1, 0, 0]])
Wss_0 =  np.array([[0, 0, 0]]).T
Wo_0 =   np.array([[0]])
f1 =     lambda x: x
f2 =     lambda x: x
start_state = np.array([[-2, 0, 0]]).T
auto = RNN(Wsx, Wss, Wo, Wss_0, Wo_0, f1, f2, start_state) yeah I did 1.6 first because he was almost done and didn't want to do 1.6 
Michael Lu: mother fucker did the entire thing already 
Allen Huang: lmao almost give me question 2 
Michael Lu: fuccccc me 
Allen Huang: what the hell is 2.2b 
Michael Lu: surprisingly i think it's just the matrix of transitions for C multiplied by gamma 0.8 0.9* 
Allen Huang: you know what sounds about right 
Michael Lu: what does max a' do max a' R(s' a') 
Allen Huang: It's the max value of a' that maximizes Q or R 
Michael Lu: yes but is max a' max a' R(s' a') a term ^ entire one term 
Allen Huang: it's just argmax 
Michael Lu: so it returns the a that maximimzed R? 
Allen Huang: yeah 
Michael Lu: but but how is a a scalar 
Allen Huang: i don't think a's a scalar a is just an action it's just the max element a that 
Michael Lu: so how do u multiply that by the output of T 
Allen Huang: what the fuck 
Michael Lu: lol 
Allen Huang: oh I tink it's just the max value of R and Q 
Michael Lu: so max a' R(s', a') is the maximum value of R 
Allen Huang: yeah sounds like it 
Michael Lu: but like do u know like it tho i need 3 .B because it uses this equation 
Allen Huang: hang on I'm teaching someone 
Michael Lu: lol aight 
Allen Huang: oh what the fuck I guess you just assume the best action was taken? wait idgi 
Michael Lu: saem 
Allen Huang: is it not just the max reward you could possibly get in the future why is 3b so fucked 
Michael Lu: idk lol 
Allen Huang: the fucking discount factor that's why it's the fucking discount factor [0.81,0.09,1.09,1.09,1.62,1.62,2.18,2.18] 
Michael Lu: F i used 2.18 3.18* 
Allen Huang: congrats what's 3c 
Michael Lu: lmao idk i'm pretty sure you just do the same process but add them onto the values from 3b or instead of multiplying by max a' R(s', a') 
Allen Huang: you use Q(s',a') 
Michael Lu: you muiltply by Qh-1 
Allen Huang: right yeah 
Michael Lu: yeah but idk what value that is 
Allen Huang: lmao same I just skipped it 
Michael Lu: is it just 3b 
Allen Huang: no I tried that 
Michael Lu: like gamma * Sigma T * (whatever corresponding value in 3b) [1.0287, 1.4103, 1.7542, 1.7542, 1.9116, 1.9116, 2.8523, 2.8523] 
Allen Huang: oh fuck I get it 
Michael Lu: pain in the ass to calc 
Allen Huang: thank you for your sacrifice what did you get for 4.2D 
Michael Lu: Dude I have no fucking clue lol 
Allen Huang: apparently it's gamma**9 in the numerator because it's future value we're just dumb 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Allen Huang: this coding section is way too long for its own good 
Michael Lu: I ageee Itâs a shit show 
Allen Huang: fuck this shit what's even going on in 5.1b 
Michael Lu: Basically argmax For 5.1a Find the action that gets you the result of the value method from 5.1a 
Allen Huang: rigt ok how do we randomly draw in the next one fuck thx 
Michael Lu: Iâm making u debug my code for the next one I figure weâll finish faster 
Allen Huang: yeah that sounds good 
Michael Lu: RIP def value_iteration(mdp, q, eps = 0.01, max_iters=1000):
    # Your code here
    q_old = q.copy()
        
    while True:
        q_old_max = 0
        q_new_max = 0
        q_new = q.copy()
        for s in q_old.states:
            for a in q_old.actions:
                q_sum = 0
                for sp, prob in mdp.transition_model(s, a).getAllProbs():
                    q_sum += prob * value(q_old, sp)
                q_new.set(s, a, mdp.reward_fn(s, a) + mdp.discount_factor * q_sum)
                
            if value(q_old, s) > q_old_max:

            return q_new
            
        q_old = q_new.copy() I just fixed it that was cancer 
Allen Huang: shouldn't there be something for max iters apparently it just works for you 
Michael Lu: the test cases are unneeding of max iters i guess? 
Allen Huang: wait what's the opint of max iters lmfao 
Michael Lu: prob good practice 
Allen Huang: yeah 
Michael Lu: in the event that test cases get more computationally beefy 
Allen Huang: well that's funny 
Michael Lu: replace the True in while True if u rlly want to make max_iters feel loved 
Allen Huang: already done now our answers are slightly different 
Michael Lu: Lol Wait u coded it already? 
Allen Huang: you gotta add a return statement on the outside too in case no convergence it really doesn't matter though 
Michael Lu: wait lmao u figured it out in the time it took me to send code :o 
Allen Huang: there's a template isn't there 
Michael Lu: yeah lol v big brain sir 
Allen Huang: love to hear it 
Michael Lu: how do u calculate the sigma expression in one line without iterating through the transition model 
Allen Huang: why would you not want to iterate through the transition model 
Michael Lu: oh i was just wondering if there was a "numpy-esque" shortcut 
Allen Huang: lmao unfortunate 
Michael Lu: F why was this weeks hw so lengthy F 
Allen Huang: what's the recursion for hthe laston e 
Michael Lu: you have to call q_em for h - 1 
Allen Huang: ok yes but jk i got it jk I didn't wait don't you just do the same thing you did in the previous one 
Michael Lu: Yeah Basically Just instead of qmax Itâs a recursive q_em call 
Allen Huang: do we calculate a qmax I thought we just add everything from the recursion whoop alright I didn't know we were supposed to call the q_em recursion with a again thought we had to call it with all the actions 
Michael Lu: o f 
Allen Huang: wait why do we not care about the other possible actions past the first iteration 
Michael Lu: Wdym 
Allen Huang: like when we call the recursive step with h1- h-1 why do we only do it for a again 
Michael Lu: You still iterate through all possible transitions 
Allen Huang: but you never change the policy 
Michael Lu: Because the scope of the problem is smaller in this situation Itâs little q I guess 
Allen Huang: huh 
Michael Lu: So like ur not supposed to consider all policies 
Allen Huang: cause you always consider like only b or only c 
Michael Lu: For the sake of efficiency 
Allen Huang: but in the solution for the previous question they consider both b and c 
Michael Lu: Yes Am reading the big paragraph under 5.3 that I previously skipped If the state space is huge Wait in this method the policy and action are a parameters Policy and state* 
Allen Huang: what does that mean 
Michael Lu: So this might be a subfunction for a given state and policy 
Allen Huang: that's just stupid 
Michael Lu: Idk I think itâs a different situation from 5.2 regardless 
Allen Huang: why would you care about a horizon h Q value that's only calculated using one policy that's like not a tree traversal 
Michael Lu: I think itâs to select a bound Maybe

Michael Lu: yes it makes no sense it's so stupid and Theo didn't help me 
Allen Huang: F 
Michael Lu: do u want the code/answer for #3 
Allen Huang: yes daddy 
Michael Lu: the code might be wrong especially, the update method but it gives u the answer

Allen Huang: no he got stuck on number 3 too lmao 
Michael Lu: #3 took a while but I'm pretty sure all our code has to be actually correct to work for #4 which is ass 
Allen Huang: well does that mean we have to rewrite your number 3 
Michael Lu: maybe the error is how i'm constructing the data X and Y tho 
Allen Huang: well I'm going to try to understand this first 
Michael Lu: do TAs have all the answers to the HW? 
Allen Huang: yeah 
Michael Lu: alright ima bug theo more 
Allen Huang: hm for number 4 shouldn't the tabular ones not depend on number 3 why are they also not working 
Michael Lu: Itâs very random

Allen Huang: did you just run it until it accepted it 
Michael Lu: Yeah u have to guess the value of iters Until your score becomes 100 
Allen Huang: what how many iterations do you even need for this then 
Michael Lu: Large powers of 10 Which is just fucking stupid Because it takes several minutes to run 
Allen Huang: fuck this lab homework jesus what the shit uh how do I get past this NotImplementedError what do we do after fixing mdp10.py it's not saving? 
Michael Lu: Yo implement 
Allen Huang: well yeah but even after implementing 
Michael Lu: Which one 
Allen Huang: it's still giving a notimplementederror? Nn Q-Lern alright I have an idea why don't we just copy paste the last parts but change the beginning true/false statements to match with what we're supposed to get 
Michael Lu: Lmao I tried to parse the hex string But thereâs some level of encryption thatâs added So idk if we can cheat 
Allen Huang: isn't the part that says True/True or True/False all the same though 
Michael Lu: yeah everythings the same format 
Allen Huang: we can just figuer out where that part ends and then copy paste in a False/False or something we can just figure out what the False/False string is from running 4D 
Michael Lu: i guess but how to you "figure out" that shit it's a hex string 
Allen Huang: do you have an example of a string output by C or D I don't have any 
Michael Lu: 286c70300a4930300a614930300a61286c70310a284c304c0a4631302e300a7470320a61284c3130304c0a4631302e300a7470330a61284c3230304c0a46352e330a7470340a61284c3330304c0a4631342e330a7470350a61284c3430304c0a46372e360a7470360a61284c3530304c0a46352e300a7470370a61284c3630304c0a46372e300a7470380a61284c3730304c0a46352e300a7470390a61284c3830304c0a46382e330a747031300a61284c3930304c0a4631342e300a747031310a61612e 
Allen Huang: is the beginning of this true or false 
Michael Lu: False, False 
Allen Huang: oh the encryption isn't just in the beginning of the string alright this is too much of a pain in the ass 
Michael Lu: i updated the code for #3 so it'll at least run for #4 Nvm it only runs for 4.3 
Allen Huang: what the shit 
Michael Lu: Itâs because the data types for elements in the data tuple keep changing First theyâre integers, then theyâre tuple, now theyâre numpy arrays 
Allen Huang: lmao 4C 286c70300a4930300a614930300a61286c70310a284c304c0a46392e330a7470320a61284c35304c0a4632372e380a7470330a61284c3130304c0a4636382e340a7470340a61284c3135304c0a463130302e300a7470350a61284c3230304c0a463130302e300a7470360a61284c3235304c0a463130302e300a7470370a61284c3330304c0a463130302e300a7470380a61284c3335304c0a4638332e300a7470390a61284c3430304c0a463130302e300a747031300a61284c3435304c0a463130302e300a747031310a61612e I didn't actually do it I just reverse engineered a correct string 286c70300a4930300a614930310a61286c70310a284c304c0a46392e330a7470320a61284c35304c0a4632372e380a7470330a61284c3130304c0a4636382e340a7470340a61284c3135304c0a463130302e300a7470350a61284c3230304c0a463130302e300a7470360a61284c3235304c0a463130302e300a7470370a61284c3330304c0a463130302e300a7470380a61284c3335304c0a4638332e300a7470390a61284c3430304c0a463130302e300a747031300a61284c3435304c0a463130302e300a747031310a61612e there's one for 4D lmfao 
Michael Lu: No fucking way lmao How the fuck 
Allen Huang: they give you the encryption function if you alt click it all I had to do was copy paste the encryption function into the colab and then give it valid numbers to encrypt I was right 
Michael Lu: alt click what? 
Allen Huang: they only check to see if there's a 100.0 somewhere in a tuple and if the opening booleans are correct 
Michael Lu: yeah makes sense 
Allen Huang: wait I just alt clicked the test_learn_play there's a line in there that specifies the encryption for the string to print 
Michael Lu: alt click in the collab? 
Allen Huang: yup I don't know what it is on windows but something like that option click maybe it opens up the py files that are referenced and then after that it's just some nice copy pasting 
Michael Lu: lemme check the download code 
Allen Huang: it's def in there too 
Michael Lu: toHex(pickle.dumps([tabular, batch, scores], 0).decode()) 
Allen Huang: yeah lmao 
Michael Lu: Allen you dirty cockbag XD 
Allen Huang: path of least resistance my guy do you want to sit there wiating for 20 minutes or just reverse engineer some correct solutions 
Michael Lu: u right u right lmfo allen big brain big dick energy only 
Allen Huang: wait is it just me or does code run faster when you tell google to use the tpu 
Michael Lu: in collab? does it default to CPU? 
Allen Huang: yeah defaults to cpu this time was set to GPU for some reason even though there wasn't anything that used it

Michael Lu: Well duh 
Amanda Miao: hes on a diff level

Michael Lu: Snake? 
Amanda Miao: yoo lol all of our grade i liked school tho! work was fun! hahahahha ethan and i bonded strongly over our lack of happiness 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Amanda Miao: hbu girl 
Michael Lu: What about me girl 
Amanda Miao: idk how was your junior year i didnt know u back then shock 
Michael Lu: Good until feb 
Amanda Miao: scioly? 
Michael Lu: Ummm Robotics + NHD + Scioly = lose sleep And then relationship problems So I felt pretty worthless 
Amanda Miao: aww oh yeah :( no yeah mine went downhill from january on ebaee lmao 
Michael Lu: Idk too much about that lol 
Amanda Miao: ebae? 
Michael Lu: I guess usually itâs the mid year crisis 
Amanda Miao: i guess haha ya eric was probably the worst decision i made in my entire life 
Michael Lu: U and him? 
Amanda Miao: mhmm i liked him for 2 years same with him except it was weird and then i hate how certain people got involved  and i dont like drama or attention drawn to these things so i kinda dropped it 
Michael Lu: Is that why u ended it? Or something Idj Idk 
Amanda Miao: and this was when we were basically gonna date (after 2 years of being a thing) and i decided to just let go and i was kinda eh and bummed about it bc i liked him up until this summer and was questioning whether i made the right choice or not but i think it was for the better bc he's just emotionless and a f*ckboy and no one approved of him lol 
Michael Lu: Lol breakups are always tough man but in retrospect Ur usually right :) 
Amanda Miao: and now its kinda weird bc i see him everyday at starbucks and  idk why he acts so hot then cold but then ppl say we had a weird history so makes sense its ok bc i laugh about it now in retrospect i guess it kinda sucks when i think back and realized i spent basically half my high school on a boy lol not even a decent onE!! TSK @men who string you on and give you mixed signals but uk its fine im fine everythings fine LMAO 
Michael Lu: Wow u wrote a lot Dam 
Amanda Miao: not even close dude think about how fucked up our history kinda is we met at hosa were a huge thing and super close then he ghosted me then hmu again the following year friends AGAIN then ghosted me 
Michael Lu: He prob wasnât maturing I guess 
Amanda Miao: and after 3 months of not talking i then went to nicole's New Year's party we both made poor decisions to drink (havent drank since then lol kinda scarred) and we kinda hu then keannyn and i babysat barfboy and were great friends actually and then the next day he wants to date me 
Michael Lu: Junior year? 
Amanda Miao: and im like um dude u kind of have a girlfriend yeah and they break up 
Michael Lu: Wow jeez 
Amanda Miao: and he thinks i'll want to date him and um the catch is i had to wait til march bc apparently he was "busy" but everyone knew it was because in reality he was flirting with tessie dong 
Michael Lu: Oh shit 
Amanda Miao: and basically if they didnt work out he would wanna date me which i thought was hella messed up 
Michael Lu: Oh Thatâs fucked us Up 
Amanda Miao: and i was trying to be rational and my friends talked me out of it so i said no like im not gonna just wait to date you his personality is the opposite of mine so idek why i liked him and yeah so also aryaa is super possessive and "she found him first: so she hated me all of last year bc i was close with eric and that was really oof because its just annoying have bad vibes and hate all around uk so the minute i stopped talking to eric she was all of a sudden fine with me again 
Michael Lu: Dam 
Amanda Miao: mhm and so this summer he started texting me like crazy again we hung out a few times i thought it was cool, uk? then he tries getting close to chloe bc the thing with eric is if a girl is "hard to impress" he goes after them just for "fun" like the seniors last year but yeah chloe knew what a dick he was and ghosted him so he got kinda shook i guess bc hes eric- who would ever ignore him? wow! so then he got pissed and ghosted ME someone clearly needs to grow up but whatever 
Michael Lu: Dam thatâs a tough junior year 
Amanda Miao: im just tired and i dont give two fucks anymore nah the drama wasnt that bad/ out there it was more of an internal thing 
Michael Lu: I feel bad Never knew shit like that happened 
Amanda Miao: but yeah and now its kind of a joke between sharon jen and i because they always joke about my poor decisions ya i remember ethan and i were grinding bio and the minute eric walked in my face went completely white so he knew but now its like sm better im just whatever/ chill about it so dont feel bad haha in retrospect this was all dumb anyways so 
Michael Lu: Dam my bad Didnât mean to remind u of that shit :( 
Amanda Miao: lol what i just told u bc u probs were confused at those ebae references jen ethan and i would often make 
Michael Lu: Literally no idea u went through that tho 
Amanda Miao: emotional stress but hey at least school went swell nah dw im not depressed at all talking about it anymore its been a whole summer and we've both matured so NOW you know i'm not smiling/happy all the time hbu litty do u mind me asking about u and jen? 
Michael Lu: Lol yeah what u wanna know 
Amanda Miao: idk what happened :( 
Michael Lu: Lol not as exciting as urs 
Amanda Miao: "exciting" interesting choice of a word ho 
Michael Lu: Shit My b 
Amanda Miao: haha im jk 
Michael Lu: Well she was onto me by the end of soph And like every year in high school I try to wash out more of the shitty antisocial past So I went after her I guess But like A) I had SATs B. I was nervous bc first time So like I asked her out 2 months into the school year Worked out rlly well Then she kept on getting sick and her parents didnât let her go out And relationship went downhill, I got no sleep from clubs, she stopped being into it 
Amanda Miao: oh so you both rarely had time for each other 
Michael Lu: I had time Either she didnât have it Or she didnât want to make time Iâll never know 
Amanda Miao: i feel like having no time is sometimes bs and its all about what u make of it bc i had this convo with miriam but yeah i get it it sucks :( 
Michael Lu: Yeah idk man it was tough For me And then I got the vibe she wasnât into it so I broke up in March Hoped I wouldnât get as cold as ethan But it took like two months for her to chill the fuck out 
Amanda Miao: 2?? damn well mad respect for you in the sense that you at least tried to keep things civil uk 
Michael Lu: Yeah it was tough 
Amanda Miao: aww im sorry to hear :'( is it better now though? 
Michael Lu: Well at least weâre not beefing like You know 
Amanda Miao: do you feel like its still awkward? 
Michael Lu: :) 
Amanda Miao: yeah waay better than jen and ethan uk those two 5 year olds need to figure something out haha 
Michael Lu: I think itâs fine We def donât talk as much Which sometimes makes me wonder whether she liked me out of whin 
Amanda Miao: was jen luo a close friend before? 
Michael Lu: Or whether I was a good person to be friends with No Sheâs tricky imo 
Amanda Miao: maybe a whim? 
Michael Lu: TBH 
Amanda Miao: i feel like its hard when you lose your friend & relationship at the same time uk 
Michael Lu: Iâm pretty sure a lot of guys are into her lol Like will I am and Anthony 
Amanda Miao: i heard something about weiting or william or whatever but oh lol damn 
Michael Lu: Yeah I had to Slaughter will 
Amanda Miao: no. 
Michael Lu: It was interesting 
Amanda Miao: will yan? jesus christ 
Michael Lu: Well I was civil But he was like 
Amanda Miao: yeah props to you 
Michael Lu: Snooping in jen phone And like getting paranoid Then like breaking up made me feel bad that I destroyed his soul in vain Like a lot of guys that go after Jen have been going after her for years Iâm pretty sure Lol itâs wierd XD 
Amanda Miao: omg yikes 
Michael Lu: Amanda 
Amanda Miao: i cant relate to jen 
Michael Lu: Understand that I cane from a nerd society Much less dynamic Fewer options 
Amanda Miao: uk how many ppl have walked up to me and said if i were a boy they would date me omg litty shut up 
Michael Lu: Boys are more desperate 
Amanda Miao: okay but you're not a "nerd" anymore 
Michael Lu: Whatevs in the past 
Amanda Miao: hey girlll you step up your game 
Michael Lu: Like thatâs how you get the ugly Brian Cho Kat thibg 
Amanda Miao: omg will never ask questions about that 
Michael Lu: Brian flirts with her for a year Then gets rejected 
Amanda Miao: he just doesnt know how to play his cards u guys just gotta go for it 
Michael Lu: Yeah thatâs the thing about that friend group Hey can I tell u a secret 
Amanda Miao: yeah my mouth is sealed 
Michael Lu: That birthday shit Strange 
Amanda Miao: wdym> 
Michael Lu: Had to watch Will and Ethan fighting for Jen Luo or something idj Idk B Cho trying to get with Kat 
Amanda Miao: okay will i get ethan? yeah b and k were a lil strange 
Michael Lu: From wills paranoid point of view 
Amanda Miao: so will rlly likes jen L and he gets paranoid if other boys talk to her? or try to get close of smthg? damn 
Michael Lu: The thing that hurts me the most is when ppl donât learn from the past Thatâs why when Ethan colds Jen Wang for a second time It hurts When will goes after Jen Luo again and again and doesnât progress It hurts When Brian Cho goes after girls in the wrong way It hurts 
Amanda Miao: i completely agree 
Michael Lu: Like not looking them down But its like I feel bad 
Amanda Miao: will i dont get tho? he should just make a move? its dumb to linger and live in paranoia 
Michael Lu: That they have to go through this 
Amanda Miao: yeah its emotional stress whether you realize it or not 
Michael Lu: He canât make a move he comes across as rude or awkward 
Amanda Miao: yeah see thats the thing 
Michael Lu: All of these guys in pretty sure Have some fundamental flaw 
Amanda Miao: will and brian are a little more socially awkward and they dont get the cues as much 
Michael Lu: That hinders progress 
Amanda Miao: so i kinda feel bad and it sucks but :( uk what i dont get when ppl say the chase is the most fun its the worst lol 
Michael Lu: Lol yeah 
Amanda Miao: why cant guys just be straightforward especially bc girls tend to overthink whatever just saying brian shouldve asked kat earlier i feel bad bc the longer he waits the more he liked her 
Michael Lu: Yeah waiting is definitely a killer 
Amanda Miao: like take me, i wimped and didnt do something until 2 years later and took almost 1 year to forget about it it sucks ngl 
Michael Lu: Saem I should have asked Jen out earlier and broke up earlier Waiting is bad 
Amanda Miao: yup :( hey we both now know sigh 
Michael Lu: Learning the hard way 
Amanda Miao: yup 
Michael Lu: #junioryear 
Amanda Miao: hey at least now u know litty titty up that game girlll dont be one of those people who get all cynical about relationships just bc of a bad one 
Michael Lu: Well ofc not 
Amanda Miao: remember that you deserve sm better when ppl like pram just tell me how disgusting relationships are but u cant just become cynical and shut ppl out uk 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Amanda Miao: lol still dead at "nerd society" 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Amanda Miao: do you actually see a social hierarchy everything kinda blurs together for me 
Michael Lu: I do. 
Amanda Miao: except brian or will and etc 
Michael Lu: Because Iâve climbed it 
Amanda Miao: bravo hahah 
Michael Lu: Maybe Iâm delusional But whatevs Lol 
Amanda Miao: what are they bottom? antisocial nerds? mid? social nerds top? dumb japs? lol idgi

Amanda Miao: minus deep bc deep is not decent but go on ethan classy? 
Michael Lu: Like able to be social Or fake being social 
Amanda Miao: u sure? ya 
Michael Lu: Wdym Ethan ainât classy or ainât a nerd lol Well he might not be a nerd 
Amanda Miao: apparently i didnt know how many guys in our grade and the grade above us despised him theres def good qualities to ethan he just needs to compartmentalize 
Michael Lu: Idk why do they not like him 
Amanda Miao: he's pretty condescending :l not to me but others uk ive seen it 
Michael Lu: Yeah I guess I see yeah 
Amanda Miao: but theres more i just dont know and i dont think i want to 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Amanda Miao: ok so whats after a "classy nerd" 
Michael Lu: Then the scale is based on how much you Party and drink lol 
Amanda Miao: omg lol LOL

Amanda Miao: LOLLL so not the boys 
Michael Lu: Dam did I lose all my guy friends??? I donât know nick well enough to uncover his dark side so heâs still fair game I guess Lol To all the boys Iâve been friends with 
Amanda Miao: U never had great guy friends 
Michael Lu: Theyâre getting messed up I guess 
Amanda Miao: HAHAHAH GOOD ONE^^^ come chill w/us tmr! jk we're probs not cool enough for u 
Michael Lu: So ummmmm The thing is right 
Amanda Miao: ? 
Michael Lu: Ethanâs locked me down But like I still wanna hang with yâall 
Amanda Miao: wait wdym can u explain further 
Michael Lu: :/ I got dinner with him today to make sure he was still alive (He kinda was) He said he wanted moral support at 10:00 
Amanda Miao: am? 
Michael Lu: Yes 
Amanda Miao: yikes :( so hes not comfortable with you hanging w us? 
Michael Lu: Umm he told me he walked into sb Saw Jen and Annie Walked out immediately and hiked to the main library 
Amanda Miao: yeaa i was wondering why he left so soon? So he wants to confront jen.. but not in person? Idgi 
Michael Lu: Idk itâs Immature 
Amanda Miao: Sigh â¹ï¸ Thatâs rough 
Michael Lu: Yeah Iâll find u tho eventually 
Amanda Miao: Find me? Huh 
Michael Lu: U guys When Jen leaves with Etha irk lol Idk 
Amanda Miao: Theyâre meeting up? 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Amanda Miao: Tmr? Jen and Annie and I were gonna go to main lib lol what 
Michael Lu: Yah heâs confronting 
Amanda Miao: Mmm I see Why is this so annoyinngggg Ughhhh 
Michael Lu: Bc u know Ppl 
Amanda Miao: So Ethan is better now? Bro talk 
Michael Lu: He was happy when I left him But resolute in his decision (And immaturity) 
Amanda Miao: Glad to know he still has you there for him ugh i kind of feel bad though he hasn't been the best/ kindest/ understanding friend/ person lately but i guess i can see where he's coming from and esp bc he allowed himself to become vulnerable to emotion to begin with i can kinda relate to him about the bottling up feelings and coming to terms with them months later but i feel like he needs to accept the fact that jen isn't who he wanted her to be and that what's done is done and the only way to recover is to just keep it civil & friendly idk im so lost im probably way off but eh just a piece of my thoughts 
Michael Lu: Heâs playing the wrong cards at the wrong time yeah His intelligence is a blessing and a flaw Turns him into a misguided kid sometimes :/ 
Amanda Miao: Honestly I feel like at this point there will never be a right time Itâs been too long 
Michael Lu: Yahhh *sigh* He wonât change his mind tho And Jen is pretty pissed too 
Amanda Miao: Yeah I can tell by the way sheâs texting me tonight just hope this ends soon for his sake, her sake, our sake 
Michael Lu: I swear someoneâs gonna come back crying or something Hopefully Ethan He deserves to cry 
Amanda Miao: yeah hopefully 
Michael Lu: Just let it out man 
Amanda Miao: he just needs to let it out yeah ^ 
Michael Lu: Heâs like a bottle of coke shakes up but closed 
Amanda Miao: ik the same thing happened to me- i bottled up 7 months of emotions and by the time i spilled it was too late 
Michael Lu: Shit rlly? 
Amanda Miao: and i cried hard nevertheless oh yeah should've spoke up sooner yeah, i cried for weeks straight and months after BUT it felt nice to let it all out 
Michael Lu: Yup 
Amanda Miao: just gotta let urself be vulnerable sometimes uk ethan's situation hits way too close to him home * he just needs to confide a little more, try to accept things the way it is 
Michael Lu: I feel like he only confided to Katelyn 
Amanda Miao: accept that some people are not the people we wish them to be yeah probably sucks that katelyn doesnt even respect him the same way anymore 
Michael Lu: After yesterday? 
Amanda Miao: just like seeing his true colors recently im not saying hes a terrible person but like i thought ethan was gonna be that ONE friend who would be able to understand ME but aw shucks that didnt happen :O 
Michael Lu: Damm 
Amanda Miao: yeah :( this kid needs to pick himself back up i had sm resentment and regret bottled up inside but sometimes you just have to sit down and have a long honest talk and WITHOUT the blame game 
Michael Lu: ^ def 
Amanda Miao: anyways did you get mad work done today

Amanda Miao: Kinematic & free gal Fall Help meeee 
Michael Lu: When Lol Wat u want girrrrlllll 
Amanda Miao: Laterrr Iâll do a practice quiz first I asked Rachel but she didnât know It was one of the webassign u helped me solve Thanks gramps! Love ya! 
Michael Lu: Np girrrrrllllllllllllllLlLLlLKSJEJSBSUDJDBRJESHSNBDJDJEND 
Amanda Miao: jeex whats up with u and gns crushes 
Michael Lu: What 
Amanda Miao: lol nvm wtf his practice quizzes are sm easier than his webassignsa 
Michael Lu: Lol I think that was last years quiz I mean u did webassign b4 u studied I guess 
Amanda Miao: true ugh idk what to do i redid every single webassign problem twice and did the quiz 
Michael Lu: Dam girrrl 
Amanda Miao: pracgtice quiz idk what else to do 
Michael Lu: U should prob be fine then Quizzes are usually webassign style questions 
Amanda Miao: okay oof 
Michael Lu: Ooooof? 
Amanda Miao: o ya i still have to ask u a part of a webassign question later 
Michael Lu: Lol is this for the quiz 
Amanda Miao: yeah why else would we discuss physics for fun? 
Michael Lu: No lol I meant is this hw u have to do 
Amanda Miao: nope just review bc im a  psychoooo 
Michael Lu: Aight aight 
Amanda Miao: math2 is literally so frustrating when u dont know how to use a calculator :'( 
Michael Lu: SAT math II ? 
Amanda Miao: ya sorry if u cant rel8 hey lmk when u have like 5 in min 
Michael Lu: I have 5 min now Finished some stupid Mooney assignment 
Amanda Miao: im gonna cry didnt realize how much shit i have to get done this week looks like im not leaving my house :'( stoppp with the fishhh i'm pusheen through the pain 
Michael Lu: Good one lol 
Amanda Miao: ur probs saying that out of pity thanks i guess i dont get the second part litty helpppp plz 
Michael Lu: 800m divides by the speed of first lap Gives the time for the 800 split 800/(220 * 1000/3600) So once you have the split You know the split for the second 800 Then divide 800 by the split to get the speed avg velocity = d/t 
Amanda Miao: didnt get the same # Lol so this is what I got from the first part Wait just to be clear since itâs 220 for first half Itâs 280 for sec half right Bc average speed overall is 250 
Michael Lu: Nah unfortunately u canât avg like that 
Amanda Miao: Wait thatâs what I thought but Rachel kosofsky said I can Gotcha lol r u helping Sharon rn I feel bad for asking too then Iâll go ask hen Jen or Ethan * 
Michael Lu: No that was A week ago 
Amanda Miao: Lol Okay nvm Would u like to help me on both parts then bc evidently I did that wrong lol Ok so what do I do after green part Once IK that t=13.0909 
Michael Lu: 24.03 - 13.09 gives ur second 800 split 
Amanda Miao: Where the heck did u get 24.03 
Michael Lu: And the duck negative splitter bc heâs like some Kenyan super duck Part 1 
Amanda Miao: No Iâm asking u how to do part one too Bc Rachel said to just average the two But thatâs wrong I guess 
Michael Lu: Ahhh ð gotcha Vavg = d/t V avg = 250 km/h or (250 * 1000/3600) m/s That was given 
Amanda Miao: Wasnât 250 for entire track overall 
Michael Lu: And d is 1600 m Yeah 
Amanda Miao: I thought weâre solving for second part 
Michael Lu: You wanted part 1? Of the question 
Amanda Miao: ^^^^^^ Yes 
Michael Lu: Yeah to get his total time 1600/(250 * 1000/3600) 
Amanda Miao: Gotcha Got it What Iâm fucking dumb I didnât even need to do that whole two part thing then 
Michael Lu: U kinda do I guess 
Amanda Miao: Okay so moving onto B Ohhhh So I take the t from part 1 
Michael Lu: Yahhh 
Amanda Miao: Subtract from 23.04 To get t for pRt 2 And then solve for Vavg 
Michael Lu: Y 
Amanda Miao: Yay i got it Kk thanks b! Ur the G! Sorry for wasting ur precious time 
Michael Lu: Np G ur a B 
Amanda Miao: Kinematics and free fall here I come ðððð

Michael Lu: Like r not rock bottom ethan in terms of emotions 
Amanda Miao: I mean I was last year so I can relate to him but I feel like he makes it extra hard on himself sometimes Itâs funny bc ppl think Iâm happier than I actually am lol 
Michael Lu: Lol yah I can see that Not a bad personality trait tho 
Amanda Miao: LOL Iâm not faking it 
Michael Lu: Ik ik 
Amanda Miao: I guess Iâve just gotten pretty good at separating situations from each other How do you deal with all this college talk I love jen and all but itâs college 99% of the time Not just jen but also everyone else So freaking annoying idk 
Michael Lu: I usually avoid it bc itâs a trigger Also lowkey for me but I just try to be cool and not offend anyone 
Amanda Miao: Iâm not even triggered at the fact that others are cutthroat about it Iâm just triggered when certain ppl just sit there And complain about how theyâre not gonna get into any college And end up at some low safety with a 99 GPA 
Michael Lu: Well yeah it triggers ppl bc they get stressed out 
Amanda Miao: I canât lol I just really canât deal Yeah like is it really necessary 
Michael Lu: I think if ppl were less vocal about stupid things it would help 
Amanda Miao: I think itâs diff if ur talking about colleges in the sense where u needa decide and shit but when it comes to getting in and applying and shitting on others Iâm just like wtf LOL 
Michael Lu: Yeah Ppl should def be lowkey sometimes 
Amanda Miao: Idk I think itâs obnoxious to cry to me about how theyâre gonna go to Bing because they got a 98 on a physics/chem/bio test And Iâm generally speaking not an angsty person AT ALL Like I donât mind when people just rant to me about colleges themselves but trashing and putting urself down is just angst-provoking Sigh 
Michael Lu: Yeah I get u What ur saying 
Amanda Miao: Itâs not the end of the world if you donât get into an ivy Itâs not the end of the world if you donât get into your dream Whatever lol Iâm not even gonna rant anymore Why canât anyone just be normal for heavens sake Whatever that doesnât exist senior year 
Michael Lu: Lol a combo of GN cancer and Asian parents 
Amanda Miao: Why do ppl think itâs ok to just walk up to others and ask âIâm not getting into college. What should I write my personal essay about? Whatâs special about me? Can u tell me? Idk I wanna get into ____ without doing any workâ wtf why the hell am I getting annoyed over college bc I always thought I would be the last person to Iâm sochill about it like I think itâs the ppl Iâm surrounded by Jesus Christ Just trying to go about my life and I donât ever get a break First school then college then Sharon comes in and back to school Like lol Iâm lowkey done 
Michael Lu: Yah gurrlllll :( Dw bout it man Dw bout other ppl Theyâll just stress u out sometimes Just shut em out when u need to itâs honestly fine Like u deserve to focus on ur self 
Amanda Miao: I canât though There are so many instances where I just wanna call x and y out and tell them to just relax and shut up but Thatâs not okay Not okay for them and even more not okay for me to call others out on it Itâs like kind of not my place Whatever this is d u m b 
Michael Lu: Yeah I see what ur saying 
Amanda Miao: This is me trying to put my pettiness and angst into words but them not coming out right ^ lol literally the reason why logan thinks Iâm an uptight non-chill person Bc when I rant it goes like this loolll Idk i realized it was toxic when I found my thought process similar to _____ and others And then you realize the superiority complex is just terrible and not that I had it but when u surround yourself with multiple people like that You rlly start to question yourself Like did I really just say that? I would normally never.. 
Michael Lu: Lol itâs fine ur ranting 
Amanda Miao: Itâs not college itself Itâs literally all the negativity and stigma and angst that comes with it 
Michael Lu: Yeah def 
Amanda Miao: Like Iâm SO stressed too but Iâm not announcing it every single second of my day Itâs not a competition 
Michael Lu: Yeah I get u me too tbh 
Amanda Miao: I donât get ittttttt Lol itâs just annoying bc people have gotten used to me ALWAYS being their biggest support system Being the one person who will always be 100% there for you But it sucks when They canât return it Yet they expect me to always give it my all its just so tiring lol I try my hardest not to burden people I really do lol I keep almost everything to myself these days bc IK how stressed people are 
Michael Lu: Yeah yeah 
Amanda Miao: But if youâre stressed and you come to me and im not âtrying as hardâ and writing an essay to comfort you and talking to you on the phone for 50000 hours You have to understand Iâm literally dying too 
Michael Lu: Prob just focus on ur self first man If u tell them That ur like sometimes in the same situation Hopefully theyâll get u idk? 
Amanda Miao: LOL people are toxic No one would The world revolves around them Itâs fine lol Iâm used to it And frankly speaking Iâm okay with it 
Michael Lu: Girrrllllllllllllllllllllll 
Amanda Miao: Iâm totally okay with being there for people bc I feel like Iâm really good at empathizing with them and providing advice and just consoling them But itâs frustrating when ppl use it as an advantage And kind of step all over me and then apologize? 
Michael Lu: Sharon? 
Amanda Miao: When all Iâve given you is nothing by my support? Not just Sharon but like Lowkey others too I mean miriam did it to me sophomore year and Did you know Emily Cheng gave me mad shit for 3 months Because I bought a shirt And she had it And she saw on social media 
Michael Lu: Ughhhh :/ 
Amanda Miao: And basically bullied me about it And even annie and Nadia were like wtf Itâs just not okay Itâs fucking dumb and superficial asf Our school is just disgusting and toxic Yet I never held a grudge about any of these thing Things Idk Pramberger comes to me Because Aryaa Is supposedly her best friend but Doesnât give her support at all And Iâm her go to person 
Michael Lu: Yah 
Amanda Miao: But like Iâm always there but when itâs my turn and Iâm down Itâs not always equal Like for me, even at the worst times, I can be fucking depressed and ill still help you through whatever youâre going through Idk Iâm not making sense at all rn lmfao 
Michael Lu: Do u ever talk to them abt this imbalance 
Amanda Miao: My emotions are so delayed rn LOL i canât even explain it Idek sharons thing really triggered a lot I suppress a lot without even realizing it 
Michael Lu: Yeah I can tell :( Dude rant more itâs fine tbh Idk to Katelyn me jen whatevs man just let it out sometimes pls 
Amanda Miao: Iâm just so upset bc how can you freaking call me a âmanipulative two faced bitchâ because I forgave miriam Iâm sorry I canât hold a grudge like you I just canât And you hated miriam for your own reasons â miriam flirted with deep, she annoys you during fockey, sheâs not straightforward â all of these things are NOT because of ME itâs highkey rough when katelyn and Mary and almost all my friends shit on Sharon for not being there for me And every time they said shit like that I would defend Sharon like crazy Like how sharons been a life long friend and how she means sm to me And it shakes me a bit to realize that Maybe theyâre right I donât know Iâve been nothing but good to her Bc I knew she and deep were going through a rough ass patch And even though I have deep dislike for deep, I never felt the need to attack her relationship because IK itâs always different when youâre the one in it I just kind of gave my advice and supported her regardless, staying by her side in case deep ever hurt her And every single week of the summer I ask you if youâre okay and to catch up/hang You leave me on read Itâs fine You say you need alone time and isolation Thatâs fine Whats not fine is You GHOSTING me and then yelling at me for not making an effort 
Michael Lu: Yeah thatâs messed up 
Amanda Miao: It was a lil ouch but I understood bc she broke up with deep She accused me of not knowing that she was mad at me How would I know One- I canât tell if you wonât hang or talk to me 
Michael Lu: Donât take it personally not ur fault man 
Amanda Miao: Two- you were going through family problems and a rough patch with deep, how was I supposed to know u had an issue with Miriam (who was ancient history) Idk I just feel like All the things Iâve done for you Have they rlly meant that little? Jesus Christ the nights I spent putting work and sleep aside for you Just so you can toss my advice and consolation away Yet I still continued doing it bc I understood and supported u And all I get in return is resentment Idk it doesnât make sense Idk Iâm being rlly annoying about it rn itâs probably not even that big of a deal 
Michael Lu: Srsly if u need to talk abt it 
Amanda Miao: Just needed to vent a bit bc I literally felt so attacked I couldnât stop crying and it was so awful and mean 
Michael Lu: Talk abt it U deserve to be listened to 
Amanda Miao: idk and it made it even worse when she dragged steph into it bc besides me the only other person she somewhat talked to was steph and she told steph all false info (and she knows it) and she overthought and called me out on "manipulating" her I LITERALLY JUST FORGAVE MIRIAM AND BECAME CLOSE AGAIN its that simple holy fucking sit shit and now i cant even look at steph the same way because im just SO TIRED 
Michael Lu: Dam :/ 
Amanda Miao: i cant even find the energy to defend myself so i just let them think what they think but steph is such a gret friend of mine and i think its just wrong to drag them into it when sharon called me out and shit or when she had issues and i didnt know the true tory not even once did i think about talking to others about it bc i didnt know if i was spreading fake shit people overthink i just think its unfair to drag other people into a mess you mafe made its inconsiderate and puts people in awkward positions the only reason why mary and pram knew about the argument was first of all - AFTER it was cleared uo and because they saw me crying so it didnt matter anyways but its just so weird man idgi sharon just viewed me as a really forgiving person and frankly speaking i raelly am like ive forgiven every single person who has done me wrong really wrong really really wrong and i have zero grudge and im not gonna blame sharon either bc its the way she is and shes going through a tough time and i guess her method of venting was arguing with me but im just mad angst and annoyed rn and im frustrated BECAUSE i normally dont feel this way i normally would get the hell over it but the fact that every time i see her i feel the need to tunnel vision or look away reminds me that theres something im holding back and i dont like drama so i dont wanna confront either so its just there lol and its really irrelevant but just annoying petty and small really but idk man idek what im saying anymore whatever im done i think lol this usually happens and then im all calm and okay for a good 6 months 
Michael Lu: 6 months its all over :) 
Amanda Miao: i think ive just had sm bad luck back to back nonstop from miriam to kenneth to ... to eric to now 
Michael Lu: Dude youâve had it tough 
Amanda Miao: investing all my emotion and compassion into people undeserving of it ..i feel drained, tired, used and the minute i just let it be im called an angsty bitch lol like the amount of times ive poured my heart and soul out to someone and had it broken lmao probably worse than ethan liking all the wrong people or befriending the wrong people sorry im not you jen i dont have a go-to pickle who just embraces all parts of me but it doesnt mean i "recycle my friends" its highkey offensive like there are certain friends that are there for certain things/ parts of me -- whether it be emotion, humor, rationale, school, etc. idk now im being petty lol disregard me im just going on now 
Michael Lu: Whattt keep going man itâs fine 
Amanda Miao: idk where im going lol im just spewing random shit 
Michael Lu: Thatâs called venting man itâs good for u 
Amanda Miao: the absolute worst feeling for me is when im accused of something im not/ didnt do and im just too tired to defend/justify myself/my actions i feel so wronged ive learned to not care then i get called a heartless bitch lol it doesnt end people are so toxic no matter how kind they seem why do you think lynne had sm beef with the seniors toxicity all around man everyone just sucks the amount of times logan hou and i had deep convos and he called me out on being an uptight, non-chill bitch and aryaa/michelle being angels and i cant even defend myself because that would just make me really look like a bitch so everytime i talk to him i have to go along with the fact that im this mean person im really not with a low ass EQ which i dont even have in fact! but its just frustrating bc when im the slightest bit genuine, it just looks bad because everyone is just f a k e as fuck or last year when aryaa got angsty at me bc i got close to katelyn and eric because katelyn was pissed at aryaa for being a terrible friend and i was a decent one why is that my fault why do you have you go out of your way to  make MY life absolutely miserablke but ofc being the person i am, i gave in cut off all ties with eric distanced myself slightly from "YOUR" best friend right because one person cant be "shared" lol grow up the fact that i had to give up two parts of my life that actually gave me some enjoyment just so you can stop giving me shit and the fact that youre super nice to me now despite all the crap i received last year but whatever seeing you bully nicole everyday and getting away with it pisses me off everyones so mean to each other and its really just pissing me off when people hype me up to be real and then im genuine and express my true opinions but everyone else is a fucking coward and continues to be fake it just makes me look bitchy as fuck when i cared sm about everything last year and yall didnt but im burnt this year and giving u up and now YALL wanna do work okay lmk ! when the only thing that matters to most girls is the number of likes they get on an instagram post or how superficially "beautiful" they look or the boys they've been with everything is just so superficial and when people rant to me about other girls being ugly and its just fucking awful and when i defend those being shit on oh im the bitch? im "acting weird" ? just trying to be a decent human being i dont SHIT on people for the grades they get i dont ignore you bc you juul/smoke/take regular classes/ party just because i dont dont feel the need to look down on people like that its just unnecessary everyone has their own strengths gah im done i think lol yeah so you see litty, my junior year REALLY hasnt been all that great 
Michael Lu: ð aww

Amanda Miao: O Itâs ok sorry bout that Ethan ended up answering a few questions I had 
Michael Lu: Lol aight aight 
Amanda Miao: Whatâs 55 Why is it 1 
Michael Lu: Did u learn lhopitals? 
Amanda Miao: Briefly but he said try not to use it tmrw 
Michael Lu: Aight aight So u know the rule ln(Ax) = ln(A) + ln(x) 
Amanda Miao: OH yeah 
Michael Lu: 10/10 yuh 
Amanda Miao: Ln (2x-3x)? Wait no 
Michael Lu: Do dat for the numerator and denominator 
Amanda Miao: What LMFAO Got it Got it Bro Iâm kidding I donât ð 
Michael Lu: Yah so if x â> infinity The constant rlly donât matter bc ln(x) is so big that ln(2) or ln(3) is irrelephant ð So itâs basically ln(x)/ln(x) 
Amanda Miao: Which is 1 So Ethan mentioned something Bc Infinity over infinity is usually infinity But In some cases itâs 1 
Michael Lu: Lol qot 
Amanda Miao: Tf 
Michael Lu: Yeah Pretty legit 
Amanda Miao: Ya I wonât ask 
Michael Lu: ð ð ethan Itâs like lhopitals stuff

Michael Lu: Omg what If itâs still between nick and Ethan Nick XD jk 
Amanda Miao: Ya Ur terrible Why is Ethan oddly nice to me lol lmk 
Michael Lu: Idk whatâs the dilemma 
Amanda Miao: So like I forgot that I promised miriam I would def do Halloween w her 
Michael Lu: O 
Amanda Miao: But like I either would join you guys, Aryaa/jana/michelle/etc group, or pram/nadia/kathleen/etc And I told miriam would join us But she was like nahhh Iâm the only white oerson And so sheâs like Iâll join whichever one has the better costume And Iâm def gonna do it with miriam no doubt so 
Michael Lu: Did u tell Mary? 
Amanda Miao: But I feel bad if I donât end up doing it with Mary bc then Iâm kinda a shitty friend for flaking Not yet she doesnât have her phone rn Also it makes more sense bc all my classes are with jana Aryaa miriam 
Michael Lu: So Miriam might join us? Or completely nah 
Amanda Miao: Might... seems like sheâs leaning towards other group tho They have rlly cool ideas hahaha Maybe if Kenneth joined us she would but highly doubt Kenneth would do it 
Michael Lu: Whatâs he doing 
Amanda Miao: No idea Haha oh well 
Michael Lu: What u want to do 
Amanda Miao: Ahhhh Floater problems lmfao Ummm Right now, Iâm def with miriam, and sheâs leaning a lot towards them so maybe them No offense but their ideas trump toy story/hippies ðððð 
Michael Lu: Lol then join em I guess XD Convince Mary to follow u? 
Amanda Miao: Maybe I will haha gotta let mary know first See the thing us Is None of them like Mary So Awkward ð 
Michael Lu: Tf 
Amanda Miao: Yeah Mary has beef with a lot of ppl in our grade Like almost everyone lol Itâs really hard I try to include her in everything but I get shit on for doing so 
Michael Lu: Oops 
Amanda Miao: Cause like all her friends are guys Sigh 
Michael Lu: O 
Amanda Miao: Mm yeah I wouldâve asked for Mary to join but I wouldâve gotten mad shit And Aryaa wouldâve said absolutely not anyways LOL Aryaaâs like a lauren Wong â hates 80% of ppl 
Michael Lu: So whoâs in ur group? 
Amanda Miao: Aryaa jana Michelle miriam etc I could also do nadia Kathleen pram Irena grace But I wanna be w miriam so Ugh this is hard Doing with u Mary predator would be fun too But we all have zero classes together so itâs not as fun in that sense too 
Michael Lu: Lol dude Iâm fine with u doing your own thing in another group 
Amanda Miao: IK haha 
Michael Lu: I guess youâd have to ask Mary But if u wanna do it with whoever go for it 
Amanda Miao: LOL I donât have to ask but I feel bad 
Michael Lu: Lol then donât itâs just Halloween 
Amanda Miao: Whatever itâs a minor dilemma I just didnât want Mary to take it personally lmfao Better costume wins for me lol

Michael Lu: Doesnât necessarily switch direction Just passes whatever place is at 0

Michael Lu: Hah itâs what sleep does to u Yo 
Amanda Miao: ? 
Michael Lu: Have u ever Went thru life wearing one contact Lens 
Amanda Miao: No Maybe like five min 
Michael Lu: Oml Like today my right eye lens was fucking with me I think bc itâs shaped that itâs not completely round 
Amanda Miao: Ohhh maybe Or maybe cause your eyes are dry Due to lack of sleep That happens to me 
Michael Lu: Haha saemmmm So I took it out And lived with one eye being functional 
Amanda Miao: Oh god Idk how u did that That would give me major ocd 
Michael Lu: Rlly is ur vision bad?

Michael Lu: Zð¤ð¤ð¤ 
Amanda Miao: Mmmm Hey can I be serious for a sec 
Michael Lu: Yeah what 
Amanda Miao: Donât take what Iâm saying too seriously but Iâve been thinking So Iâve been thinking that we maybe rushed things by making it âofficialâ so soon? Ik I said it first by asking u but I didnât rlly know what would mean Idk how to explain it but like putting a relationship label on it is making me feel sm more different from what I expected 
Michael Lu: Hmmm Mhm 
Amanda Miao: I just find it a little weird that Katelyn and them refer to u as my boyfriend when we havenât even been on a date yet and plus, I donât know that much about u uk? Idk 
Michael Lu: Lol what who?? 
Amanda Miao: And like the way I process things Are super delayed And I guess there are still a few things that happened earlier/ last year that still make me in this weird grey area And so itâs probably not fair to you Iâm Uk* Itâs rlly hard to explain but thinking of myself in a relationship kind of freaks me out and I totally didnât expect it 
Michael Lu: Yeah understandable 
Amanda Miao: Idk I was just catching up with Pram and I remember her telling me how she canât ever hang with me and Eric at the same time again because what went down was pretty pretty darn bad and worse than what I made it out to be and I kind of realized that I ignored a lot of it and the minute this thing kind of happened triggered the same kind of sinking feeling I had before Idk this is so hard to explain I guess maybe Iâm a lil freaked and Im confused by the idea of jumping into something not completely confident/sure Idk lemme know what you are thinking 
Michael Lu: Yeah if ur not ready I understand If you need to say something Amanda, say it. 
Amanda Miao: I mean I kind of said whatâs on my mind What are you thinking 
Michael Lu: I did not expect u to get all hyped abt âofficialâ and what not since we didnât even go on a date yet. TBH before u do anything from this point on, just be more conscience abt ur thoughts. And donât be afraid to be honest 
Amanda Miao: ^^ ik I totally agree with u Thatâs what Iâm just trying to say @hyping a relationship and
Not even going on a date Yeah I mean Iâm being honest right now because I felt wrong dragging it out 
Michael Lu: So whatâs ur plan 
Amanda Miao: Idk I was hoping u had something to say too 
Michael Lu: Lol I guess I Just did then 
Amanda Miao: Sorry something came up I had to finish a lab with Aryaa But Iâm trying rlly hard not to be the bad guy uk I felt a little off and idk I felt like it was the right thing if I explained why I was a little awkward 
Michael Lu: Oh ok 
Amanda Miao: So we good ðð»? 
Michael Lu: We good ð I reread our convo I kinda get what ur sayin Sry if I was a bit rude or something :/ If u ever need to say something just lmk Iâll be open to u Aight gnite :)

Michael Lu: Lol does Ethan want more attention or something idgi 
Amanda Miao: can* Yeah Idk he wants to reconcile their close friendship But itâs never going to happen 
Michael Lu: âClose friendshipâ 
Amanda Miao: Itâs like me going back to Eric and saying letâs be best friends again Like I would probably be Ethan In the sense that we think everythingâs completely fine But Eric/Jen were probs affected more by it too but it was just less obvious/spoken of Trauma man Whatever The only hope they have is if they date again, or else a close friendship is impossible 
Michael Lu: World would turn upside down And I would never be sober if they crack at it again for the third time 
Amanda Miao: Like I would date Eric again but I wouldnât be close friends Like would u ever be best friends with Jen L again Probs not Idk Ethanâs being unrealistic rn 
Michael Lu: Ughhh how r u not dead yet? Physics + Botany + Chinese wasnât enough? 
Amanda Miao: LOL Okay so Iâm fucking pissed bc she moved Chinese to tmr So I wasted time studying for Chinese instead physics Lol I failed that test today Justin Lin and Aryaa got 40 points lower than me So I think itâs not too bad But yeah I bombed it bad Itâs all relative LOL

Amanda Miao: lol he looked shocked today i was like in ur fucking face deep! 
Michael Lu: Wait what u do 
Amanda Miao: idk i was in town with eric and apparently theres a rumor going around that we're dating which is hilarious but he tihnks my life is miserable with eric bc it was when i told sharon back then and he was like lol ur a loser and he saw me in town with friends and he looked like :O 
Michael Lu: Lol deep has issues sometimes XD 
Amanda Miao: he does im just glad i kind of narrowed the tension gap between ebae not deep lol that could be as wide as the atlantic ocean i could care less 
Michael Lu: I mean what good would deep be in anyoneâs life tbh Besides robotics or cars or music and shit XD 
Amanda Miao: lol i guess uk knowing sharon she would stick it out with deep as long as possible just to prove me wrong even if it means her being miserable 
Michael Lu: Dammmmmm Is thatâs whatâs been going on all these years? 
Amanda Miao: yeah 
Michael Lu: Big ooof 
Amanda Miao: sigh tis a complicated life i found out sm about shit today 
Michael Lu: What shid man? 
Amanda Miao: That Eric was apparently just as affected as me and perhaps even worse He just never showed it/ told me And yeah other stuff not about Eric but we donât talk about it haha Patrick has said enough to ppl Had a deep talk with Logan and yeah he gave good advice Hmm what else Iâm just a confused soul Michelle took one look at my playlist and Called me depressed ðððbc itâs her depressed playlist Just a confused  childLOL 
Michael Lu: Quite the shiiiit man Somebody has an interesting life ð 
Amanda Miao: Nah Not rlly Frustrating I hate guys No offense not u 
Michael Lu: Ik ik 
Amanda Miao: Smh so hard to read Not Eric lol

Michael Lu: Y 
Amanda Miao: Heâs like this nice Christian boy but Heâs also a fuckboyish jock I FaceTimed Patrick for three hours and he had this convo with Jared Jared was just rating girls 1-10 for two hours straight And was kinda shallow To my shock 
Michael Lu: Jared Jared Jared 
Amanda Miao: He rated steph a 3/10 Iâm like BRO U HAVE HUGE STANDARDS 
Michael Lu: Has Jared ever datÃ¨d? 
Amanda Miao: lmao apparently Matt ko and Henry both called me cute while dating Mary and Mary just told me and Iâm like no fucking way haha And yeah He said once in freshman year This girl from LaGuardia And he broke up with her bc sheâs âweirdâ Bc she was a little depressed and harming herself 
Michael Lu: High standards I guess 
Amanda Miao: And may and I were like.. tsk tsk Mary* & so I was like ð¤¨ð¤¨ð¤¨ U win some u lose some So Iâm surprised Jared is this sweet ass soul who acts like a fuckboy when heâs mad inexperienced (according to Logan) One example of how guys are complicated too And then Patrickâs like âI have ten tabs open on diff girls, just playing aroundâ âMore guys are like that than u thinkâ Ethanâs just another species thatâs completely hard to read Then we have Jason lee Who acts like the biggest fuckboy proudly announcing that he gives no fuck about personality Haha lol heâs one of the most innocent boys ik So u see B o y s are dumb too And complicated Girls arenât only the ones hard to read ahaha Wow that was quite the rant 
Michael Lu: ð§ð§ð§ 
Amanda Miao: Sigh Donât even try to analyze this haha just a general rant

Michael Lu: Ommmgg what he do This time :/ 
Amanda Miao: lol im not gonna go into specifics but i was in the car with kaitlin tung and he overheard and like butted in afterwards and projected his bitter emotions onto my situation lets just say kaitlin and i were talking about someone and hes so messed up from jen hes literally like along the lines of basically he cornered me and angrily asked me questions for 3 min straight 
Michael Lu: Ew â¹ï¸ 
Amanda Miao: ikkkkk hes like liking someone is overrated ppl like u burn bridges its not all fun and games what do u fucking expect to get out of having interest in someone are you dumb or something and like kaitlin and i had this whole mentality along with jason logan samuel etc "its senior year why not go for it" lol so like i was like ethan stop taking it so seriously he was so bitter i was like brooooooo i recorded half of it lmfao katelyn fully flipped her shit 
Michael Lu: Lol tf 
Amanda Miao: yeah bc he was so rude im like bitch and he started trash talking katelyn and nick which pissed me the fuck off and oh hes so offended okay im gonna be honest uk how he puts ppl like nick and jared on this pedestal 
Michael Lu: Yeah yeah ik 
Amanda Miao: like i hung out with jared the other day for quite a long time and we all talk and patrick and jason lee has been telling me shit i see scree shots like he heard me talking about how jareds been really shallow/ thirsty bc hes friends with andy and that squad now and its just hitting him now and a week ago i was like "ethan how do u feel about someone who spends 3 hours rating girls' looks from a 1-10" and he was like "i would never be friends with them " im lowkey like yo bro lol its jared but obviously didnt say anything he assumed eric and i were dating or something which is false and hilarious and so in the car i was like ethan... yeah so like jared is after mad girls now and yeah hes shallow but thats completely separate from whetehr or not ur a good person him being the stubborn ass he is he literally just rolls his eyes and spews back the nastiest statements ever im like lol stop overreacting hes like "i respect ppl like nick and logan and jared" lol jared has gone to the dark side in terms of the dating/ girls scene i dont blame him i mean havent they all umm guys are just diff and i was like *most guys like i love logan hes a mush and i will always respect him but even he has rated girls and said some questionable things like amanda why is __ with __ hes a 10 and shes a fucking 3 and he was like trying to argue with me on how he knows them best and im like bro but u dont no offense but theyre not gonna approach u and talk about that stuff its like the locker room bro talk uk what i mean like its inevitable 
Michael Lu: Yeah yeah 
Amanda Miao: idk that wasnt the argument i just needed to rant a lil it was something specific which i shall not get into but im heateddddd lol a night's sleep on it will do the trick 
Michael Lu: ð agrE 
Amanda Miao: lol i just facetimed lynne 
Michael Lu: How she 
Amanda Miao: and its insane how identical we are in terms of high school expereiince like and personality in a way like i felt so much better bc i didnt even have to fill her in i said like one sentence and she goes, "ur the same. so u feel this way.. etc etc" and its so relieving like she telepathic or something and to know that someone the exact same as u has been through the identical situation 
Michael Lu: Yuh 
Amanda Miao: from sophomore to senior year and like stress and school and yeah harvard is really hard rn i met her friends lol theyre all mushes she was saying how obvious gns is toxic but u dont truly realize how bad it is til after

Conversation:
Amanda Miao: Hey litty quick question bc I think Will is sleeping or doing something rn How do Uk if something conditionally converges or absolutely converges 
Michael Lu: ð¤ð¤ð¤ I think u do the absolute convergence test If it converges with the test itâs absolute And If it diverges with the test But converges with another test then itâs conditionally convergent If u can prove series converges with the absolute series test itâs absolutely convergent. If the series is convergent but you canât get that based on the absolute series test itâs conditionally convergent. If it diverges based on the absolute series test, itâs just divergent. Lol shit sry essay ðð 
Amanda Miao: Can u do this with alternating series test Is that the same thing omfg lol Will is confusing me too lmfao Like how would u go about 13 and 17 *13 and *19 Lmfao wait Iâm dumb Alternating series tests and absolute/conditional convergence tests are different? 
Michael Lu: Yep 
Amanda Miao: yikess 
Michael Lu: 13 and 17 are rlly just alternating harmonic series 
Amanda Miao: so thus conditional convergence? 
Michael Lu: Oui oui oui 
Amanda Miao: so like will was saying for the AST the three main steps are 1) figure out if its alternating 2) if it converges to 0 3) if it converges using ratio test? are those the right steps at least ^ 
Michael Lu: 3) if it decreases in absolute value 
Amanda Miao: but i can use ratio test to determine that right or do u suggest plug in chug 
Michael Lu: Yeah you could do ratio test to show that But itâs to show that it decreases in absolute value 
Amanda Miao: okay so thats AST whats the diff from that and convergence tests for absolute/conditional for absolute/conditional am i just looking at the problem to see if the absolute value converges or smthg i feeel like its the same 
Michael Lu: Absolute convergence test You take the absolute value of all that shit Regardless if it alternates or not And so convergence tests on the absolute valued series To prove conditional/absolute convergence 
Amanda Miao: so for conditional/convergence tests i can kind of disregard the whole 3 step thing from AST The way I look at it is If I take the absolute value of the whole thing Iâm basically looking at 1/3k Which is conditional bc thereâs a harmonic in there Does that even make logical sense lmfao And how for 19 I disregarded the (-1)^k+1 part And k+2/ k(k+3) has that 1/k harmonic Iâm there In* Making it conditional? Idk thatâs how I did it but idk if itâs even mathematically correct/valid 
Michael Lu: 13. It diverges absolutely u need another test to prove conditional convergence Lol 19 idk if u can do it like that Just use AST I gues 
Amanda Miao: Haha kk thanks

Michael Lu: Lol rlly? 
Amanda Miao: Thereâs no deep plot!! U canât even resonate or connect with the characters Itâs great to just pass time But I canât binge them 
Michael Lu: Dam someone has high standard ms 
Amanda Miao: I like those shows where they build on character uk yep Netflex 
Michael Lu: Lol I mean parks and recreation kinda develops characters Office is just funny af 
Amanda Miao: Hahaha yes I watch for the vines and memes The fosters got a 97% on rotten tomatoes I have good taste 
Michael Lu: Lol I guess 
Amanda Miao: Chloe shames on me Bc she thinks Shameless is a better show but While it is, fosters >> U shud check it out LOL jk who am I kidding ðð¤¦ð»ââï¸ 
Michael Lu: Wats shameless 
Amanda Miao: A similar show More ratchet and R rated Theyâre both similar in the sense where they involve families that experience terrible things 
Michael Lu: Oh thatâs sad 
Amanda Miao: Shameless is just messed up and depressing but itâs rlly good Fosters is diff in a way 
Michael Lu: Wait how much fosters u watch today

Amanda Miao: Doesnât matter 
Michael Lu: So I hate Spotify 
Amanda Miao: Follow me LOL makes sense 
Michael Lu: Bro the ads 
Amanda Miao: Why are the ads that bad 
Michael Lu: The fucking ads 
Amanda Miao: Chloe says they arenât 
Michael Lu: Also itâs super hard to figure out Because to make it worthwhile u need premium features 
Amanda Miao: Dude if I can figure it out that must mean itâs easy af 
Michael Lu: Or unlimited data 
Amanda Miao: Ok lol yeah that makes sense Use Spotify on your computer itâs easier No shuffle play I think Spotify is same on computer no? Just w ads 
Michael Lu: Why Spotify on computer when thereâs YouTube 
Amanda Miao: Bc playlists Spotify is where you ~discover music~ 
Michael Lu: There are online playlist makers with YouTube 
Amanda Miao: Unless ur an ethan who replays the same 3 songs for 1 year straight Just sayin my playlists r bomb 
Michael Lu: Sure yeah sure I trust u Hereâs my playlists 
Amanda Miao: âPolitical playlistâ 
Michael Lu: Woah what Shit Forgot to remove that 
Amanda Miao: LMFAO I still canât believe u listen to rap I thought u were jazz man tsk 
Michael Lu: Ughhh ofc I listen to rap Iâm a guy âLittyâ

Amanda Miao: Do u prefer rah rah music or sad music 
Michael Lu: Whatâs rah rah? Like upbeat stuff 
Amanda Miao: YA LOL MY B 
Michael Lu: tHe fORmEr 
Amanda Miao: Ya basic *snaps* 
Michael Lu: At least Iâm not emo 
Amanda Miao: Jk idk itâs interesting bc some ppl just hate sad music Nah the emo music is upbeat 
Michael Lu: Sad music what kind 
Amanda Miao: I mean emo as in like u wanna cry and rip ur heart out sad music 
Michael Lu: Iâm assuming like this is about pop? 
Amanda Miao: Iike uk whatâs interesting 
Michael Lu: Or something 
Amanda Miao: Ew no lol Pop sucks ish Like anyways 
Michael Lu: Sad classical and rap is good 
Amanda Miao: So some ppl just hate slow sad songs 
Michael Lu: Whatevs 
Amanda Miao: Idk cause they canât resonate or empathize But whatâs interesting is Those who can appreciate is sm and itâs usually those that have a heavy/sad soul 
Michael Lu: Like 
Amanda Miao: Like Chloe u can tell bc when ross and I showed her 21 pilots music thereâs only specific ones she liked Itâs just cool uk 
Michael Lu: Lol Chloeâs emo or something ? 
Amanda Miao: Kinda Not âemoâ LOL I got shat on by ppl like pram and Aryaa bc of my sad songs LOLOL but ppl likechloe and Sharon meanwhile only listen to sad songs But tbh sad songs are so subjective just bc any song can be âsadâ objectively, but if u associate something with a song then itâs flat out depressing lol 
Michael Lu: Dam hella emo I mean i guess yah 
Amanda Miao: You know whatâs objectively one of the saddest songs 
Michael Lu: Qot 
Amanda Miao: But then also bc it blew up from 13 reasons and we all know what that show was about ð¤·ð»ââï¸ 
Michael Lu: Whatâs the song image donât load 
Amanda Miao: The night we met- lord Huron Almost everyone knows it tho itâs a classic so Iâm not surprised if u know it 
Michael Lu: Dam Lemme check it out 
Amanda Miao: itâs acquired taste 
Michael Lu: Hella emo song man 
Amanda Miao: My Starbucks playlist is 325 songs just as emo ðð­ 
Michael Lu: Lol whatâs up with u 
Amanda Miao: Idek lol I had my sad phase it lasted a good 8 months HAHA âhappy personality with a heavy soulâ isnât that wat they all say 
Michael Lu: Dam u had a sad phase??? 
Amanda Miao: LOL o yea 
Michael Lu: This year ? Junior year? 
Amanda Miao: I think ppl just classified me as âsadâ End of sophomore and almost all of junior 
Michael Lu: Dammm 
Amanda Miao: Not academic or school related Yes LOL 
Michael Lu: Hard to believe Like actually sad? 
Amanda Miao: Oh yes Hard to believe if u donât know know me bc most ppl think Iâm just a ball of laughter BHAHA which I will not sent Deny* 
Michael Lu: #hidethepain? 
Amanda Miao: LOL at some point Ethan tried psychoanalyzing me when we first met and said my laughter was a coping mechanism Letâs just say Ethan shud never become a psychiatrist 
Michael Lu: Lol OFC lol okay sadmanda 
Amanda Miao: Itâs ok tons of ppl have bubbly personalities with sad souls Itâs just the way they are ð¤·ð»ââï¸ 
Michael Lu: Wait so like Whatâs the diff between sadmanda and regular Amanda 
Amanda Miao: Yeah like Iâve met ppl like that Hmmm How to explain this Well âregular Amandaâ is just me 
Michael Lu: Wow 
Amanda Miao: Sadmanda is part of it 
Michael Lu: What 
Amanda Miao: HAHA 
Michael Lu: The fucking worst explanation No offense 
Amanda Miao: LOL I realized Ok hmm So Youâre not two faced bc ur both rlly happy and sad but Youâre happy and laugh a lot But thereâs so much empathy in a person/ and emotions that one can get more sad than an average person (like Ethan) Like I had this talk with others and Ross is like that too Sharon too 
Michael Lu: What the fuck 
Amanda Miao: Except sheâs more sad LOL see itâs weird to explain 
Michael Lu: I guess Iâm more straightforward? 
Amanda Miao: What LOL 
Michael Lu: So I wouldnât understand 
Amanda Miao: what does that have to do w anything Iâm straightforward too ho 
Michael Lu: Idk how this works 
Amanda Miao: Letâs use Ethan as an example Heâs more logical and rational 
Michael Lu: Aight aight 
Amanda Miao: When he broke up with jen obviously he was upset but he was more logical about it and wasnât as upset Same w jen 
Michael Lu: Yah 
Amanda Miao: But letâs use someone like Sharon Way less logic and rationality 
Michael Lu: O shit Katelyn told me she has like 
Amanda Miao: No lol we all dislike deep heâs terrible she knows that I had to guide her through 10 breakups and they always end up together again heâs toxic 
Michael Lu: Dam a lot of fucking info is coming in 
Amanda Miao: I donât like that kid tsk tsk 
Michael Lu: Haha 
Amanda Miao: Sorry my b ik heâs ur robotic  buddy 
Michael Lu: Nah itâs aight Iâve heard Some stuff 
Amanda Miao: He thinks Sharon shouldnât have any friends while being her girlfriend tsk rsk 
Michael Lu: Before 
Amanda Miao: Yeah Iâm sure u have Toxicity at its finest But ya guess litty ling has no sad soul 
Michael Lu: I do Just I donât get what this personal duplicity is So like ur dad Sad* But u cover it up? Or u just joke about it? Idk 
Amanda Miao: LOL no I guess itâs like when You can be super super happy but once youâre sad, you fall hard and itâs the worst 
Michael Lu: Oh so like fickle 
Amanda Miao: See not rlly bc itâs always a part of you Just lingering 
Michael Lu: And then it just grows at one moment And fucks u up 
Amanda Miao: Lol I guess 
Michael Lu: W O T 
Amanda Miao: Like itâs good I guess bc u carry sm more empathy with you Like do you cry just seeing someone else sad/cry 
Michael Lu: Hahahahaha Nope 
Amanda Miao: I always do that lol itâs probs not the best teait BAHHAHAHA YA Iâll be netflexing in Starbucks and bawling over every single episode Frankly itâs quite hilarious 
Michael Lu: O dam 
Amanda Miao: ð¤·ð»ââï¸ð¤·ð»ââï¸ð­ð­ð­ 
Michael Lu: So like Sharon 
Amanda Miao: Hm? 
Michael Lu: can be super super happy but once sheâs sad, she falls hard and itâs the worst 
Amanda Miao: Thatâs more me, sheâs less of the laughing obviously Itâs HARD to explaim 
Michael Lu: Lol I wanna get this man Gotta understand HUMAN NATURR 
Amanda Miao: Haha itâs hard like when I met Ross I could just tell Heâs basically me but the moment u talk to them u can just kinda tell And he talked about it once bc it came up And I was like bingo Chloe was like tf man 
Michael Lu: Whatâs Chloe like 
Amanda Miao: Very very reserved Less emotions 
Michael Lu: O shit 
Amanda Miao: Yeah 
Michael Lu: So like Opposite of u? 
Amanda Miao: In a way yeah but itâs crazy how we get along so well Hm weird But she doesnât get get me uk like she doesnât know sadmanda Only a few truly doð¤·ð»ââï¸ so nbd 
Michael Lu: So if thereâs an Amanda - Chloe spectrum 
Amanda Miao: if someone like Chloe saw me crying it would be âomfg wtf whatttt etcâ vs if Sharon/pram/miriam saw me theyâd be âso wats up wat happenedâ Iâm terrible at explanations pardon me Maybe u just canât get human nature 
Michael Lu: Wtf Oof 
Amanda Miao: Iâm kidding haha Iâve always wondered whoâs more cold- u or Ethan BAHHAHA 
Michael Lu: Good question We can both be cold-hearted assholes Lol u prob know 
Amanda Miao: Totes my goats Great answer

Conversation:
Andy La: wait is the the angle complementary of what we wrote isnt the 30 degrees 30 degrees from the horizontal and how did you find the initial velocity did you averge the averge? 
Michael Lu: The angle is 90 - what we wrote The initial velocity I used the time that gave us the smallest percent error 
Andy La: oh i got 17.8685 
Michael Lu: For wat 
Andy La: vi 
Michael Lu: Which 
Andy La: oh shit

Michael Lu: Yah saem graph 
Andy La: 18.31 m/s for the projectile 22.1 for straight up 
Michael Lu: Ya basically What time did u use 
Andy La: i averaged the time for the straight up 
Michael Lu: Lol just use the smallest one Gives u lowest percent rrror 
Andy La: how much was the perrcent error 
Michael Lu: 10% 
Andy La: okay 20.48 then 
Michael Lu: Yeah

Michael Lu: Free fall? 
Andy La: okay same you dont need to explain righ 
Michael Lu: U do 
Andy La: but it doesnt say to

Andy La: thot? bro 
Michael Lu: #10 MC for the new one 
Andy La: how would i know if you dont 
Michael Lu: because we've wittled down the choices 
Andy La: i can take a guess for you 
Michael Lu: #10: it's note equal and non-zero, or not enough info, not the disk is greater So it's either friction is equal and zero or the ring experiences more friction try equal to zero 
Andy La: The force of friction is equal and non-zero for both objects.? 
Michael Lu: force is equal and ZERO equal to zero 
Andy La: ahhh okay 
Michael Lu: help a brotha out 
Andy La: incorrect "The force of friction is equal to zero for both objects" 
Michael Lu: ring is greater? 
Andy La: do you need another guesser? LMAO 
Michael Lu: yes 
Andy La: okay ill ask mona what do you want me to make her put 
Michael Lu: ring is greater 
Andy La: is this your question btw "An ideal uniform solid disk and an ideal uniform ring each have mass M and radius R. Each object begins purely rolling without slipping down a rough inclined plane. The coefficients of friction for the disk and ring with the incline are 
Î¼disk > Î¼ring." 
Michael Lu: yeah is she online? 
Andy La: she doesnt want to do it she thinks its very sus because she didnt do this weeks yet LOL 
Michael Lu: haha lol 
Andy La: wait she said fine she'll do it 
Michael Lu: oh ok 
Andy La: The ring experiences a greater force of friction than the disk that choice right 
Michael Lu: put michelle li on the line yes 
Andy La: LOLOL 
Michael Lu: fuqqin saw mona tag u and michelle li in some meme abt getting passed awk stage 
Andy La: GEEZ STOP 
Michael Lu: aight andy aight. 
Andy La: which choice did you pick for the question 
Michael Lu: we need more info is she gonna pick the ring exp more friction 
Andy La: yea did you pull jen into this

Michael Lu: how many ppl are involved in the greatest heist of the century

Andy La: SHES SO SLOW BRUH she doesnt run track chill LOL 
Michael Lu: lmao deadass abt to get somebody else les go boiiii 
Andy La: LMAO LOL SHES TRYING TO THINK ABOUT IT why cant it be equal and nonzero 
Michael Lu: because i guess they need friction to roll tbh this webass concept made no sense 
Andy La: dayum okay shes being slow go get someone else 
Michael Lu: boi already did

Annie Yang: ok then what do you need me for 
Michael Lu: (and your notes from last year :)) is the test a lot of math? 
Annie Yang: hmmm michelle handled the math last year i think for regionals there's an ok amount of math 
Michael Lu: 50%? 30%? 
Annie Yang: uhh yea somewhere in that range there used to be a lot less math like 10% but i know it's not like that anymore if you want to place well you have to know the math 
Michael Lu: is the concept-based stuff easy? Like blatant facts know-or-not? 
Annie Yang: i guess two years ago it used to be pretty easy fact recall there's still definitely some of that but nowadays you have to know how to apply concepts idk if they go that hard during regionals but if you know how to identify properties of stars from stuff like spectrographs you'd be pretty comfortable

Should it be a more implicit/subtle action or a more explicit/obvious action 
Annie Zhang: Either is fine 
Just focus on really deeply developing an idea if u want it to fit the theme use key words sometimes but You can basically make anything fit the theme 
Michael Lu: yeah but wut u do 
Annie Zhang: Both Idk I canât really categorize it 
Michael Lu: i is surpriz 
Annie Zhang: K 
Michael Lu: lol but like, it don't got to be like im shoving the writing into the theme hole like i do for NHD

Michael Lu: Dam was urs more interesting? 
Annie Zhang: Also my part of the lab shut down No 
Michael Lu: XD 
Annie Zhang: Idk it depends Iâm more interested in using machine learning to improve understanding of environmental engineering but thatâs more pure comp sci 
Michael Lu: Oh I see 
Annie Zhang: So thatâs cool too 
Michael Lu: So is Malik 
Annie Zhang: I think it suits u 
Michael Lu: A gov worker or is he independent?

Michael Lu: Srsly he grades on half work? I donât get it 
Annie Zhang: Sure heâs just objective Wait Subjective no one knows 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: So when Manuel grades is the emphasis on content or writing mechanics? Content as in analysis I suppose 
Annie Zhang: Writing mechanics Make sound pretty 
Michael Lu: Lol sry for bugging u with Manuel shut Finally met him today Though he is sufficient eye candy that satiates me for 40 minutes He is intimidating 
Annie Zhang: LOL omg Yep 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Quick question: What did your college counselor do that a normal person couldnât? 
Annie Zhang: lol Uhm they know exactly what the colleges like to hear from years of experiences Aka hacks 
Michael Lu: Is that stuff not available else where lol 
Annie Zhang: Where is it available u tell me itâs like insider secrets Ur paying for experience 
Michael Lu: Lol like paying for big data Ok annice 
Annie Zhang: I mean itâs just a lot easier the process is hard enough LOL 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Annice where u early Just wonder 
Annie Zhang: Princeton 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Anie 
Annie Zhang: Huh 
Michael Lu: Umm 
Annie Zhang: What 
Michael Lu: Mind if I bug u again with college 
Annie Zhang: ya Go So recently Iâve been rereading a lot of my college essays Bc I recently made a blog about all of them 
Michael Lu: Omg must find!!! 
Annie Zhang: Uhm basically for me I donât think you should be repetitive but donât make your character contradictory either Nope Itâs hidden so itâs public but not searchable Basically everything should make sense and everything should add a layer to you as a person Demonstrate passion by legit demonstrating passion lmao if u really want to talk about a certain topic go for it 
Admissions officers can see past you if you write about a topic you think they want to read I prob didnât answer all ur questions but ya Idk if ur still confused 
Michael Lu: So character should not be reiterated 
Annie Zhang: Letâs say ur thing is community service 
U should not write explicitly about community service every essay but different parts of u where it maybe makes sense that u do community service Or just good traits in general
Problem solver
Can work in teams ur passion should go deeper than the act itself Like liking community service is one thing But why do you love it Do u love learning do u love helping can u empathize Good? 
Michael Lu: Well Did ur responses to questions span a variety of extracurriculars Or did they stay focused on one academic spike? (Or two) Variety of extracurriculars = different genres of stuff such as community service and then lab and then performing arts 
Annie Zhang: I mean depends on each school and how many essays I generally gave them a holistic view Obviously I like stem but other things are important to me as well Donât overwhelm them or just focus on extracurriculars
Tell them about who u are 
Michael Lu: Yeah ik thatâs my next question 
Annie Zhang: The incidents you choose to write stories about should tell them about what extracurriculars u are in by mention but it should mainly be about character like I wrote about something that happened in lab that taught me something 
By mention they knew that I did lab and research 
Michael Lu: So did each supplement develop a different character trait? 
Annie Zhang: depends on how many essays 
Michael Lu: Assuming like 3 sups 
Annie Zhang: Usually u only get chance in an app to develop character traits assuming 3 soups 1 Is prob about ur major 2 is prob about something important to you where you can develop character trait 3 is prob like something about that school or engineering focus idk They should all show a little bit of character tho But obviously #2 u can develop that much more 
Michael Lu: Aight so basically If I were hypothetically a mechanical engineer Itâs fine to talk about being a running ass Brian Cho once in a while And not come off as âooh dat guy well rounded not passion abt engineer instarejectâ 
Annie Zhang: Absolutely fine Actually I encourage 
Michael Lu: Is there a penalty to not focusing on a major-related passion throughout the sup Iâm paranoid it makes me less memorable/summarizable 
Annie Zhang: Just make it obvious that u like aspects of mechanical engineering 
Like sprinkle it through
Donât just talk about it tho
 talk abot running sure even better connect running to aspects of why u like mechanical engineering 
Michael Lu: Haha ew 
Annie Zhang: Idk u need endurance for both of them idk some shit Nah thatâs what works tho high key Or like PROBLEM SOLVING 
Michael Lu: Maybe in a diff context Lol aight hereâs the shid Doing Brown U rn 
Annie Zhang: or my thing I guess was like being an engineer and also everything else I did, the work can never be perfect, itâs never done but Iâm okay just always striving to make it better I didnât do brown sorry Canât liberal arts lmao Didnât apply to any lmao Wellllll 
Michael Lu: Lol what a god I mean the gist is 
Annie Zhang: Not brown level liberal arts 
Michael Lu: I yâall abt film, engineering, and running over the span of 3 essays Talk* Is there a penalty to no focus? 
Annie Zhang: I did like Yale and duke which is close enough but I mean I didnât get in 
Uhm that sounds pretty good 
Michael Lu: No passion no spike 
Annie Zhang: Brown is liberal arts 
Michael Lu: ð¤ What abt Stanford 
Annie Zhang: That sounds fine but make more cohesive I guess 
Michael Lu: Cohesive due to character Idk 
Annie Zhang: Like if itâs liberal arts make sure you say a liberal artsy thing about character and about why you like ur stem major Stanford is U just pray Lmao and if no ieso 
Pray every day Uhm yeah honestly idk about any school but mit really LOL or I guess I know a decent amount about the schools I actually got I. 
Michael Lu: When u did MIT what was ur approach to like the focus across several questions 
Annie Zhang: My mit essays were so shitty I read them again today while blogging no focus at all Every essay completely different side of me yeah idk why they accepted me but In the essays ofc the major essay you talk about why u like mech e 
Michael Lu: Research? NASA? Brooooookhaven 
Annie Zhang: But I wouldnât over focus Major essay I talk about I like environmental engineering 
Only other essay where itâs stem related is the problem solving one where I talk about my first time coding so not related to my major And my research supplement tied it together probably Thatâs useful And also awards and extracurricular section is useful There focus stem heavy pretty much 
Michael Lu: U think it was hard factors or soft factors that got u in 
Annie Zhang: But essay show that ur a normal person Whatâs hard and soft 
Michael Lu: Soft = essays & interview & rec Hard = award. Stats extracurriculars etc 
Annie Zhang: Hard factors was a main reason 
Soft essays were good enough I CANT EVEN STRESS HOW MUCH INTERVIEWS MEAN NOTHING THO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING my guy was 97 years old He could not hear me Just have one And ur fine 
Michael Lu: Lol ð k 
Annie Zhang: Thatâs for every school 
Michael Lu: So I guess ur community service essay Wasnât stem related? 
Annie Zhang: Wait when did I do community service Lmao That was an example 
Michael Lu: Contribute to community essay 
Annie Zhang: Ohhhh Not at all I talked about my religion lmao 
Michael Lu: ð 
Annie Zhang: Yeah for mit u canât bs ur way in really Like thereâs only so much an essay can do 
Michael Lu: Dam 
Annie Zhang: Hard factors Are really main They need to see your work AKA SUBMIT MAKER STUFF AND RESEARCH PORTFOLIOS 
Michael Lu: Both? 
Annie Zhang: submit as much as u want it can only help I would say do both ya 
Michael Lu: What if I rlly didnât do much for research at Brookhaven 
Annie Zhang: I did art portfolio Uhm 
Michael Lu: I like did stuff My guy told me to do 
Annie Zhang: I donât really know mmm I donât remember my supplement but I remember there was a rec letter and you write about what your roles were in the project then an abstract thing and then you MAY OR MAY NOT need to attach a paper I forgot 
Michael Lu: Iâll figure it out lol Yo but I legit slept during work hours at Brookhaven 
Annie Zhang: Yeah lowkey it doesnât help unless youâve written a paper and you know exactly how your project is important 
Michael Lu: I can try to BS my contribution Very difficult tho 
Annie Zhang: Or if u donât have a paper 
You have amazing results and did really cool stuff Otherwise BSing contribution for research in comparison with other ppl who are not BSing is very difficult Donât stress about the supplement then Also it has to be rigorous 
Michael Lu: Will a weak supplement hurt or help 
Annie Zhang: Use specific technical terminology Uhmmmm for research 
If u bs it prob wonât hurt but it wonât help almost at all Bc actual staff read Ur research stuff 
Michael Lu: Yup. 
Annie Zhang: Plus admissions team are stemmy 
Michael Lu: Yurp 
Annie Zhang: U have good maker stuff tho That can really stand out 
Michael Lu: Surp 
Annie Zhang: no one else is doing stuff similar 
Michael Lu: Durp 
Annie Zhang: Lot of ppl did some compsci research tho so 
Michael Lu: Qot Who 
Annie Zhang: Ya weird horse mask videos might just get u in Uhm everyone here is compsci If u didnât know 
Michael Lu: But like Not everyone applies as comp sci right? Bc itâs so competitive? 
Annie Zhang: Uh sure??? But not really 
Michael Lu: Also what if my major is meche but my research is comp sci 
Annie Zhang: So people apply as what they really want to be 
And then once they get in they realize they want to sell out And let go of their true passions But they were once passionate Ur fine but then again like if ur research isnât rigorous Idk it itâs helpful 
Michael Lu: Lol whatevs I do It i guess 
Annie Zhang: sounds good U should showcase hard factors that make it seem like youâre passionate about mech e 
Michael Lu: Lol of cursee 
Annie Zhang: That shouldnât be that difficult cuz like Scioly u did builds and u did robotics U did compsci stuff so maybe u can be into controls which is mech e honestly just get it done and ur app doesnât have to be perfect ESP In terms of writing 
Michael Lu: Iâve got that covered plenty lol 
Annie Zhang: uhhh ok idk what that means but ok Weird flex but ok 
Michael Lu: I meant Iâve got it covered being bad at writing 
Annie Zhang: Weird flex but okay Perfect U will fit right in Jk most ppl are actually pretty good but a lot of ppl are also pretty bad 
Michael Lu: Lollll k thxxxz annnice for adviceedskzjancjdndn See u from Stony Brook or hopefully Georgia Tech 
Annie Zhang: Those are great schools dude np byee 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Lol uk A Brookhaven I took naps after lunch break And I submitted my poster in comic sans Sprinkled with typos #throwbacc 
Annie Zhang: LOLOLOLOLOL 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: When u submit research sup to MIT how do u get a rec from âmentorâ 
Annie Zhang: U email and hope they respond I emailed on 1/2 so itâs fine Donât sweat 
Michael Lu: I mean as part of the application Where is there a form for this 
Annie Zhang: Yeah u just gotta put in their email and they do the rest 
Michael Lu: Where 
Annie Zhang: Itâs on the research supp Thing Thereâs a page that asks for email 
Michael Lu: Part of the research supp slideroom? 
Annie Zhang: I think u have to fill it out or get to the end first tho 
Yes slideroom 
Michael Lu: Umm honest question What u think got u into MIT? 
Annie Zhang: Idk thereâs a video thatâs helpful tho on YouTube Iâll send it to u 
Michael Lu: Qot U have utube??? :o 
Annie Zhang: Tbh it should just be clear in ur application that you are really interested in Science and you fit Nooo a general YouTube video This is the dean of admissions He tells u how to set ur application apart But honestly this would have been more useful 4 years ago Itâs pretty good advice tho 
Michael Lu: Man Iâm talkin bout ur app Like Was it ur awards/research 
Annie Zhang: Yo watch the video tho I donât know 
Michael Lu: Watched it before 
Annie Zhang: LMAO 
Michael Lu: Very sad ð¢ Two MIT folk talking big talk 
Annie Zhang: honestly u can never know but there should be something on there that shows ur dedication and passion for Science at a high level like a love for tech engineering cs science things that goes deeper than extracurriculars, itâs like what u want to do But also a good essay about something completely different usually from Science Idk u do u I can speak for more than myself 
Michael Lu: K thekkkkkZzzszsss sannie !! 
Annie Zhang: Canât* I canât speak for more than myself lmao Ok np DUDE JUST BELIEVE IN URSELF 
Michael Lu: Lol yeah I didnât ask u to speak more than ur self lol 
Annie Zhang: Then it shouldnât matter 
Michael Lu: ð¤ð 
Annie Zhang: My application should be irrelevant to u u do u U got this !!!!! thereâs nothing u can do rn except package what u have already really well And u have a lot of good stuff So 
Michael Lu: K thxxxz anixe 
Annie Zhang: ALSO I REALLY RECOMMEND WATCHING EVEN A FEW MINITES OF 2.009 PRESENTATIONS!!! Itâs a huge deal at MIT every year itâs the senior thesis mechanical engineering class Aka BEST CLASS EVER and thereâs like 9 color teams and they spend the whole semester each designing a product and they have a huge presentation each year which is today and many of them go on to become startups The livestream is rn 
Michael Lu: :o 
Annie Zhang: On silver team! Iâll send u link if interested 
Michael Lu: Iâd love to watch itttttt But then Iâll get sad 
Annie Zhang: U can put that in some essay LOL watttt!!!! UR GREAT u got this

Michael Lu: What he did 
Annie Zhang: No Wait whyâs he at Cornell then Hahaha 
Michael Lu: Srsly wtf Cindy 
Annie Zhang: Wait Cindy Is cindy You got to at least let MIT people know Honestly you should also just tell your friends and hopefully you told your parents 
Michael Lu: I told my family I intended to tell nobody else Until May 1 To be considerate 
Annie Zhang: OK good why is that considerate 
Michael Lu: To the other thirsty competitive cancerous GNS ppl 
Annie Zhang: Wthhhh Gns Is Ughhhh Youâre gonna love the environment here 180 from Gns Learning to learn :0

Conversation:
Anthony Zhan: Yo michae L What was your projecy for hsrp I just had a call with my mentor and idk if i wanna do bcz its kinda scuffed Its like more of an internship lol 
Michael Lu: LMFAO Ur doing HSRP? At BNL? 
Anthony Zhan: Yep What did u think of it 
Michael Lu: Omegalul Whatâs ur project/department I was in CAI CSI 
Anthony Zhan: Im in rhic i think But basically they want me to make a gui w python For this event controller tool Rn its written in java and they want to update it basically But i kinda wanna do something that feels original/researchy u know Instead of being a code slave 
Michael Lu: oh complete opposite of me HSRP is supposed to be quite researchy but from my personal experience was very shitty for research because my mentor didn't rlly care about sharing his research so I did coding tasks HSRP kinda sucks balls in terms of the work environment it can be very ass I took naps, coded other projects, and dicked around with the other intern in my room BUT highly recommend u do it anyways because you get to say you "SWE interned for the Department of Energy" and that's uber big dick energy for college apps and getting internships in college (especially as a frosh) Annie Zhang (GNS year above me) did HSRP and got into MIT I did HSRP and got into MIT go figure ð®ð®ð® Unless you:
1. Really want to do research at some bumblefuck university and will probably win a competition (or idk u actually like research that much)
2. Are popping off in Math and are going to camp or MOP or whatever it's called Would highly recommend doing HSRP it can still be interesting As much as I hated it, I learned a lot and do not regret doing 
Anthony Zhan: Ok ok cool Also its all remote this yr, no rooms or anything :( 
Michael Lu: Oh big dick energy Thatâs very good What are ur other options for summer 
Anthony Zhan: Im already attending this online math program Ross program 
Michael Lu: What that 
Anthony Zhan: U can google its basically a summer program for math nerds Its also onlone this yr tho 
Michael Lu: Are u popping off in math Iâve met a lot of math boys at MIT 
Anthony Zhan: Sort of 
Michael Lu: apparently thereâs something called MOP 
Anthony Zhan: Yea mop is for gods Not me 
Michael Lu: f 
Anthony Zhan: I made usajmo last yr But didnt get any higher so idk 
Michael Lu: Ur gonna be senior next year right 
Anthony Zhan: Yep 
Michael Lu: Yeah def do HSRP 
Anthony Zhan: Im already shitting myself about college Lmao 
Michael Lu: Especially now that itâs remote 
Anthony Zhan: Ok i will 
Michael Lu: So much better 
Anthony Zhan: So its not rly research its more internship? Thats what i got from ur story 
Michael Lu: Itâs more research 
Anthony Zhan: Oh bruh 
Michael Lu: It suppsoes to be Like I had to make a poster and shit lmao 
Anthony Zhan: Yea my mentor told me that too But how can u even paint what im doing as research 
Michael Lu: Itâs just that a lot of people get cucked and donât get research tasks like me One guy Deadass got paired with an electrical maintenance dude 
Anthony Zhan: Lmao thats shitty 
Michael Lu: But he got into Columbia Engineering so all good Wdym 
Anthony Zhan: Like its just uodating an existing program to python Its not anything novel 
Michael Lu: Whatâs the research project behind it 
Anthony Zhan: Idk sounds like grunt work There is no project its a tool they use for the ion collider Thats semi outdated 
Michael Lu: Lmao Well Are u trying to be a research boy? 
Anthony Zhan: I kinda wanna ask my mentor if theres anything else I wanna do ml or smth like thag That* 
Michael Lu: Lmao shoulda went to CSI 
Anthony Zhan: Bruhhh how do i switch 
Michael Lu: Canât Ask ur mentor for more stuff But in my experience mentors kinda ass sometimes 
Anthony Zhan: My mentor seemed nice bUt idk 
Michael Lu: Thatâs good thatâs good So in my experience I hated research So I painted HSRP as SWE internship So it worked for me in all college and job apps 
Anthony Zhan: Hmmm Yea i guess i can do that too 
Michael Lu: If u need it to be research because the rest of ur activities are research Thennnn u should find ur mentors research project and steal it Or just ask for more researchy tasks 
Anthony Zhan: Bruh idk if hes even working on research Hes just like i have this projecy u might find interesring 
Michael Lu: Which is updating a GUI? 
Anthony Zhan: Yep Lmao 
Michael Lu: Big F How much do u care about Reese arch And how much do your activities comprise of research 
Anthony Zhan: Rn not a lot 
Michael Lu: For which 
Anthony Zhan: This But 
Michael Lu: Ok 
Anthony Zhan: I think research might be good way to use my skills Idk 
Michael Lu: So You like research But how much research have u done before Or r u big math boy? 
Anthony Zhan: I took honors sci research and did a stony brook thing 
Michael Lu: Simons? 
Anthony Zhan: Nah just dicked around in biochem lab for a bit It was scuffed I didnt like it 
Michael Lu: Whatâs ur college major 
Anthony Zhan: Mostly because i was just pipetting stuff Math 
Michael Lu: Big hmm 
Anthony Zhan: Cs double major possibly 
Michael Lu: I mean like Applying major I would be careful about CS very saturated. Like I was MechE and CS 
Anthony Zhan: Wait u have to declare major? 
Michael Lu: Lmao yeah how else are they gonna fill in their Minority gender studies department Itâs not binding tho 
Anthony Zhan: Ok bruh 
Michael Lu: Wait 
Anthony Zhan: Im prob applying as math 
Michael Lu: Like Iâm telling u most of what Iâm saying rn Is in the context of preparing for college app season tbh If u want me to like not consider that I can give u adjusted advice 
Anthony Zhan: Uh wdym 
Michael Lu: Like if u were a senior and didnât have to worry about college 
Anthony Zhan: Nope im worrying about college Lmfao 
Michael Lu: I would tell u to maybe not consider HSRP as much and do like interesting research If possible But Like lol Ur a junior And I would like u to not get cucked 
Anthony Zhan: How does one do interesting research 
Michael Lu: Lmao Lemme tell u the scoop at GNS Most ppl like do âinteresting researchâ Idrk As long as u stay away from bio You personally will probably find interesting 
Anthony Zhan: Im avoidinf bio at all costs dw :) 
Michael Lu: But actual research experience starts in college for most people High school research Most of the time quite fake 
Anthony Zhan: Yea thats why i think research would look good maybe? Not rly sure Like parents say colleges will be like ooh this guy big brain he do research in hs Also completely unrelated but have u heard news about avoop 
Michael Lu: Research looks good if:
1. You win awards or get into RSI, or do like a prestigious programs (HSRP is not bad)
2. You actually enjoy research u do and have dedicated a lot of time and effort to it and can adequately convey that in ur essays Most students at GNS failed at both 
Anthony Zhan: Ahhh 
Michael Lu: Parents usually donât know jack shit 
Anthony Zhan: But problem is research comps are after apps 
Michael Lu: Yeah so If u havenât got any awards And you havenât done any research you care about 
Anthony Zhan: Our school doesnt even let u enter isef until 12th lol wtf 
Michael Lu: And your HSRP experience doesnât become researchy enough 
Anthony Zhan: Whats the deal w that 
Michael Lu: Then u prob not gonna want to be a âresearch boyâ in ur apps Idk GNS is Weird I didnât do research there 
Anthony Zhan: So u didnt do any competitions? 
Michael Lu: I had work experience and did a lot of side projects HSRP was âwork experienceâ No competitions 
Anthony Zhan: Yea i guess i can also pull of a "swe intern" thing 
Michael Lu: Research was not my main selling point 
Anthony Zhan: What can i do for cs tho 
Michael Lu: Yeah if u donât do any research during HSRP then idk prob a good idea 
Anthony Zhan: Oh btw my brother showed me the video of u at saddle rock lmao 
Michael Lu: Side projects would help 
Anthony Zhan: Toby moment 
Michael Lu: Lmfao Toby was also Not bad College selling point But donât stoop to that level Big gey 
Anthony Zhan: Did u submit toby for maker portfolio 
Michael Lu: Yeah I was a maker dude 
Anthony Zhan: Lol got it 
Michael Lu: Idk if ur that type of kid tho 
Anthony Zhan: Probably not Wdym by side projects for cs Sounds interesting I wanna do somethinf w programming Besides usaco 
Michael Lu: U do usaco? 
Anthony Zhan: Yep gold Are hackathons good If win 
Michael Lu: Hackathon are gey But they help a bit So like For u USAJMO and USACO gold (tho less than USAJMO) are like pretty good Side projects for CS Are good to show ur âpassionâ 
Anthony Zhan: Can u give example For side proj 
Michael Lu: Like what I did ? 
Anthony Zhan: Yea 
Michael Lu: Lol Toby 
Anthony Zhan: Ok true 
Michael Lu: Trash can robot 
Anthony Zhan: Designing website is like Fake and gay right 
Michael Lu: Lmao 
Anthony Zhan: I feel like its too cliche 
Michael Lu: Yeah maybe u can make like math utilities I made a geometry Sketchpad rip-off in 9th grade U can do something similar 
Anthony Zhan: True if i could do something math related that would be cool 
Michael Lu: Math program Like projects donât necessarily give u a clout edge like awards But It makes it seem like ur genuinely interested in ur âmajors â 
Anthony Zhan: Mhmmmm Unrelated question What do u think of david wang taking 9 aps this yr for "clout" He self srudied like 4 or 5 I told him aps dont rly matter and he will regret 
Michael Lu: For life Good for him he learned a lot I hope For college Idk if it rlly matters that much Arenât u Stanford legacy? 
Anthony Zhan: Grad school so probably no 
Michael Lu: Might help 
Anthony Zhan: Yea i got mixed answers when i searched up 
Michael Lu: maybe EA Stan lol 
Anthony Zhan: Some ppl say its only undergrad 
Michael Lu: MIT likes ur math boy tho 
Anthony Zhan: Yessir 
Michael Lu: MIT goes hard for Olympiad ppl So maybe USAJMO help 
Anthony Zhan: Did u apply cmu scs 
Michael Lu: Yeah but I withdrew After MIT 
Anthony Zhan: Austin got rejected bruh idk how Man was nutty 
Michael Lu: From CMU? 
Anthony Zhan: Yep Early 
Michael Lu: CMU CS is hard Also They very small So they probably want like actual math 
Anthony Zhan: Ok im gonna send a pic of avoops progress report btw U know how its remote learning now

Conversation:
Aram Baghdassarian: Hey how does the knock back function in sumo work? 
Michael Lu: i used distance formula in the if statement to check if the players were within the shield radius then the velX of the player was set to the distance between them and the other player, divided by a constant the constant controls the knock back power 
Aram Baghdassarian: Oh that's smart, thanks 


Conversation:
Aram Baghdassarian: GitHub.com/Jeshaitan/scicademy Scicademy.org To find the about page, download the zip file from github, then go to public-->about.html 
Michael Lu: do i download everything or just about? 
Aram Baghdassarian: If it's possible to download just the about page and css JavaScript and library files, then do that. But I don't know if you can download only some files 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: i forked the thing on github now what for the search bar, if you remove the border property for .form-container the search bar might get a cleaner softer look or you might just want to remove the 3d thingy the search bar, you might want the styling to match the nav bar 
Aram Baghdassarian: Hey sorry I didn't respond earlier I was at church. Elderly free to remove the border property and/or 3D look and see how it looks. Also if you want you can add some effect whenever you :hover over a button because as of now noting happens 
Michael Lu: sure when i edit the css file, how do i view the final result? 
Aram Baghdassarian: Ok, there are two ways You are using notepad++? 
Michael Lu: err, is it possible to do it on github? 
Aram Baghdassarian: Oh like edit the file on github? 
Michael Lu: yeah, and see the result that's the searchbar without the border^ 
Aram Baghdassarian: Unfortunately you can't because we use this thing called herokuapp to host the server and we have to push to herokuapp whenever we have a stable website version 
Michael Lu: okee so how do i edit on notepad? 
Aram Baghdassarian: Wow that looks so much better 
Michael Lu: i don't know how to remove the 3D thingy though 
Aram Baghdassarian: Don't worry about that 
Michael Lu: okee 
Aram Baghdassarian: Just download the zip file from GitHub, then go to notepad++ and go to file---> open and navigate to the file you want to edit 
Michael Lu: which zip file? oh i see 
Aram Baghdassarian: https://github.com/jeshaitan/Scicademy/archive/master.zip Yeah 
Michael Lu: i can't open some stuff in notepad++ there's no open with option 
Aram Baghdassarian: Which ones can't you open? 
Michael Lu: umm, all of them except for some js files 
Aram Baghdassarian: did you do that? 
Michael Lu: err, when i click open, it defaults to normal notepad 
Aram Baghdassarian: oh yeah that used to happen to me too. you have to oepn notepadd++ first and open teh files from there. windows defaults to normal notepad 
Michael Lu: ok ah i can't edit anything 
Aram Baghdassarian: :( still not working? what happened? also I just added your searchbox change to the official github repositroy with a pull request 
Michael Lu: i can open files, but i can't edit :( 
Aram Baghdassarian: Are they html files? and when you open them do they go to a. webpage or go to notepad++? 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Aram Mr. Millevoi told us in class today that your sister is going to give him 30 minutes to read his speech on TV 
Aram Baghdassarian: LOL yeah he tells every year's class that. I asked my sister about it and she told me about how the first time he went to the school's show was when my sister was in it and he saw that my sister was a great actor and thought she would be really successful one day and that's why he made that deal with her 
Michael Lu: seems legit 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: hello aram how doe you import local files to github from notepad++ 
Aram Baghdassarian: You have two options: you can use GitHub's desktop app or you can learn how to use git on command prompt The desktop application is great and fast to start off with, so I would recommend it: https://desktop.github.com The git on command prompt is harder to learn but makes it easier to learn complicated things that you won't use very often If you don't have a repository that already exists that you're uploading to, then when you create a new repository and it asks you for which files you want in it, select the file (or files) that you want to be on github 
Michael Lu: thx 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: y tho ur speech was so gud ); 
Aram Baghdassarian: thanks for the kind words litty, I think that my speech only appealed to the intellectuals, so maybe there were more non-intellectuals voting than intellectauls :/ 
Michael Lu: this is the problem with democracy that's why people like trump are winning 
Aram Baghdassarian: too true litty, too true

Austin George: Hey Litty u did the HSRP at Brookhaven, right? I'm looking around for internships rn and wondering if this is a good one lol 
Michael Lu: Oooooh Iâll get back to you on that one in a sec I assume this is for college lol 
Austin George: lolol mega facts 
Michael Lu: Could I call u I got a lot to say 5163507023 Fuck it hereâs the gist lmk if u need more info: Brookhaven HSRP is a RESEARCH PROGRAM (Unless u end up interning for the electrical engineer then youâll be doing electrical maintenance) Otherwise youâll be like every other junior research Siemens regeneration Isef dick sucking fucker in your grade Lol Not to say that research is bad or boring But definitely if research is not ur thing then donât do BNL Some research areas include AI, Particle physics, nanoparticles, environmental science (Well for comp sci itâs actually a bit better bc you get to write code) (Thatâs why I called my research experience a software internshipâwriting data analysis software and AI algorithms for researchers) Youâll basically hop onto a research mentor who will let you âworkâ on their paper And maybe theyâll put your name on it and itâll be published (mega clout) ^thats one good thing Another good thing is that Brookhaven HSRP Is an INTERNSHIP at the FUCKING DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY so I have big dick energy compared to other fuckers who have no work experience at big name place Thatâs another good thing 
Austin George: HOLY HEC thanks for all the info 
Michael Lu: Oh also If ur actually into research Take it seriously I slept in the office everyday Learned a lot But hated research so I was like fuck it And colleges are shafting me now bc I didnât take bnl seriously 
Austin George: dam 
Michael Lu: Yeah but itâs pretty worth it if u like research or want big dick energy work experience 
Austin George: im lowkey into research but have zero experience bc never did it in school; def interested in coding so if i apply i hope i dont get butt fucked with like research in bio or something 
Michael Lu: Yo desdass Call me Its better my hands are tired 5163507023 
Austin George: kk

Michael Lu: I have Wells 
Avnoor Deol: is that like a disease? Like Crohns? 
Michael Lu: :/ 


Conversation:
Avnoor Deol: U skipped Intro to java right? 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Avnoor Deol: do u just ask chugh like email him or something 
Michael Lu: You ask Weiss Do you know Java already? Fluently? 
Avnoor Deol: Uh not java but python and c++ 
Michael Lu: How fluently 
Avnoor Deol: So should be able to learn java within a summer uh I was pretty fluent in both of those like two years ago So can I just learn things over the summer 
Michael Lu: Ummm what about now 
Avnoor Deol: probably not as fluent. Does he ask me to prove my skills to him or something 
Michael Lu: No I donât think so, not for me, at least 
Avnoor Deol: Whatâd u tell him 
Michael Lu: How long have you programmed in those languages and what did you do with them? 
Avnoor Deol: I made crappy games in 6th and 7th grade so thereâs that 
Michael Lu: Okay ð Do you know object orient d stuff and classes? 
Avnoor Deol: Object orient d sounds familiar Ik classes 
Michael Lu: Lol itâs aight So what you do Is go to Weiss And ask him to skip into APCS next year (This might change from year to year, but for my year) he will have to send your guidance counselor a rec Based on whether or not he thinks you are worthy. He will ask you how much you have done in Java 
Avnoor Deol: how will he think someoneâs worthy ? ? Oh crap 
Michael Lu: So itâs best to make it seem like you know java If you donât know it 
Avnoor Deol: Ok So learn in depth over summer and learn basics before course selection 
Michael Lu: Yeah, I guess 
Avnoor Deol: ok 
Michael Lu: It should be easier for you because c++ has some similar syntax and ideas with java 
Avnoor Deol: this is for me and like two other freshman to skip intro cuz itâs an annoying full year class do you know davidmo? 
Michael Lu: Wendy Moeâs lil bro 
Avnoor Deol: smol man who is programming god Yeah yeah Davidâs a legendary little man He made a Kahoot bot that answers questions randomly so we can bully ms Spence

Avnoor Deol: loser oh wait I think David did his in AHK thatâs where I did mine so c++? 
Michael Lu: Dam idk that 
Avnoor Deol: also what stupid geometry thing 
Michael Lu: Iâm getting to old Look up LittyLing codecademy

Avnoor Deol: ? go awae 
Michael Lu: Okay ð 
Avnoor Deol: Owair Actually I need U helpo 
Michael Lu: Quai 
Avnoor Deol: So Weiss said that skipping Intro is a case by case thing and itâs different for everyone and that thereâs no placement test 
Michael Lu: Yes 
Avnoor Deol: But Zinn was telling people that she like quizzes ppl 
Michael Lu: Go for Weiss 
Avnoor Deol: so I canât BS my way thru this unless Weiss is fine with me just taking online courses 
Michael Lu: Donât ask Zinn 
Avnoor Deol: Apparently Intro doesnât go into object oriented programming much at all 
Michael Lu: The only hard part is getting Weiss to remember to send the rec 
Avnoor Deol: oof 
Michael Lu: Idk I didnât take intro. 
Avnoor Deol: But Weiss told ppl to talk to Zinn 
Michael Lu: Oh 
Avnoor Deol: And they would both deal with it 
Michael Lu: Did u talk to Weiss yet? 
Avnoor Deol: I just asked him questions didnât say that I wanted to skip I asked if someone could hypothetically skip and how that works I just told him I had experience with Python and he said that Java syntax is harder and just explained what Intro goes into 
Michael Lu: So you basically asked if you could skip? Why didnât u say you knew C++? Anytime u say u know python ppl look down on u 
Avnoor Deol: cuz I just tried to learn that a couple years ago and know a little 
Michael Lu: Oh Gr8 
Avnoor Deol: yeah but C++ is hard and Iâm not gonna lie 
Michael Lu: Lol Good luck then. REEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Avnoor Deol: #2265 Every year, the SG election is a popularity contest.

The majority of the student body is not popular. The typical student does not closely resemble the typical winning candidate. Why do we keep buying into their status and casting our votes for someone who does not truly represent us? Why support those who are too cool to talk to us when they arenât running for a resume-padding position?

This year, we finally see a genuine candidate who is a man of the people. A champion of the common man who is keen on ending the reign of this popular aristocratic minority.

It is common sense that the silent majority should elect one of their own to the highest office.

We may not be equal to these other popular candidates in terms of social reputation, but we are in terms of voting.

Come Election Day, we all ought to cast our ballots to the comrade himself.

Arise oppressÃ¨d student! 
Wherever you may be...
You have nothing to lose

Michael Lu: Very impress 
Avnoor Deol: including all the âaâs and âtheâs he added to attempt to unplagiarize it 
Michael Lu: Thatâs pretty funny 
Avnoor Deol: shouldâve just put like White quotation marks At the start and end Or somewhere in between cuz 0% is sketchy I hate that the entire English dept has adopted turnitin and it doesnât really affect me 
Michael Lu: It doesnât affect most ppl Just ppl like Caleb 
Avnoor Deol: I first hand witnessed him getting roasted by whoever his teacher was Cuz I had hastings conf I didnât want to laugh cuz there were like 5 teachers and him bawling his eyes out in there but his teacher had nochill he said he wouldnât do it again and sheâs like âyes u willâ âYouâve probably done it before, and now youâve been caught, but youâre still gonna keep doing itâ

Michael Lu: Omfg USACO I tried training for it Difficult Also very boring I donât like stupid tests and Olympiadâs man TBH itâs much more meaningful for me to do personal projects or get a fucking job And not waste away and study for some award that means nothing outside of college apps But if u still like Jeremy Chen did usaco and he was good at it lol prob shouldnât rant abt this now But if awards and competitions float ur boat go for them 
Avnoor Deol: lol Iâm a sweaty man breadley doing and thatâs how I found about about the whole rankup system he sent me some of the bronze level problems and itâs mild scuff if I actually go thru w it Iâll have to tryhard to like at least silver ideally gold bread silver very nutty apparently USACO gold > AIME qualifying 
Michael Lu: Lol bullshit 
Avnoor Deol: rly idk 
Michael Lu: Exactly 
Avnoor Deol: I googled this shit earlier today 
Michael Lu: Stop listening to the toxic ppl online 
Avnoor Deol: and a bunch of sources were saying that the hierarchy is like 
Michael Lu: Okay maybe But like 
Avnoor Deol: USAMO > USAJMO > USABO = USAPHO = USACHO = USACO GOLD > AIME > USACO SILVER > USACO BRONZE = AMC 
Michael Lu: Well yeah I guess 
Avnoor Deol: Brandon got USABO semi last year thru pure guessing so his cloutometer is +++++

Michael Lu: They can guarantee college But you have to be rlly good 
Avnoor Deol: lol 
Michael Lu: Like nationally top 50 And frankly Itâs very hard and if ur pragmatic abt it Not rlly worth it in the long run if itâs even possible People like wyan bcho and etc Chase this shit Donât win Fuck 100000 hrs studying wasted 
Avnoor Deol: yea 
Michael Lu: Same with Adrian Chen Yuhan Liu prob Again if u rlly think itâs fun and good do it But I wouldnât 
Avnoor Deol: i get that u have to be like high ranking to get bang for ur buck like anthonys aime isnât getting him anywhere but if heâs USAMO heâs golden 
Michael Lu: If 
Avnoor Deol: and putting in a bunch of effort is only worth if ur finalist in smth instead of semi idk all the USAs are like questionable but interest me 
Michael Lu: Then do it Like history u could do I guess 
Avnoor Deol: My original plan was to attempt usapho but usaco exists and that seems more for me 
Michael Lu: Try it out 
Avnoor Deol: Humanities is dry like

Michael Lu: Also thank the lord your nOt Chinese 
Avnoor Deol: uh how come 
Michael Lu: It seems obvious to me ur caring about college shit already 
Avnoor Deol: I can think of a few reasons lul oh let me tell u so like Iâm not necessarily thinking about colleges specifically or anything Itâs just I see other ppl doing shit and Iâm like Oh should I be doing that 
Michael Lu: Peer pressure lol 
Avnoor Deol: And am just trying to last Not even peer pressure rly Itâs like Kind of 
Michael Lu: Errr u could try their shit 
Avnoor Deol: Nobodyâs telling me to like do shit but I feel obligated to 
Michael Lu: But donât do it if u donât like 
Avnoor Deol: College is big scary thought Thereâs a lot of thirstiness thatâs like spreading across my grade that Iâm avoiding 
Michael Lu: Fine try shit out before junior year 
Avnoor Deol: Like ever since anthony skipped to BC 
Michael Lu: Donât think abt college 
Avnoor Deol: half my grade is tryi to skip next yr 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Avnoor Deol: and Miata has basically refused everyone 
Michael Lu: Ree

Michael Lu: Bad luck 
Avnoor Deol: Kurlander idek David mo doesnât have the balls to talk to her 
Michael Lu: Itâs not rlly worth skipping tbh 
Avnoor Deol: Iâm not trying to skipcuz Ik Iâm shit at math so I donât have to stress like ppl 
Michael Lu: Multi car is so scuffed 
Avnoor Deol: Dropping research is so satisfying but made me so angry Cuz I waste 2 year 
Michael Lu: Y It happens I wasted shit ton of time on violin 
Avnoor Deol: Last year I said I wouldnât drop cuz I wasted 1 year already 
Michael Lu: Itâs ok to make mistakes bud 
Avnoor Deol: Then I had a taste of actual full yr research and I hate it 
Michael Lu: Thatâs part of learning You canât hate something without learning abt it first 
Avnoor Deol: bruvveri donât like learning I like playing games and getting success handed to me 
Michael Lu: (Unless itâs Nate Cohen in ur case) 
Avnoor Deol: Are u doing robotics just for fun Cuz thatâs basically what Iâm doing scioly for and itâs scuff as my grades slowly drop I have to like rely on ECs to boost me even tho they worn Wont* 
Michael Lu: If ur gpa is above 94 donât sweat 
Avnoor Deol: then thereâs track which is basically just a hobby at this point that I canât let go of 
Michael Lu: Yes I genuinely enjoy robotics Did it since middle school 
Avnoor Deol: track is actually a curse And I feel like you and Brian are both afflicted by it 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Avnoor Deol: u guys keep coming back And refuse to detach 
Michael Lu: Lol Errr TBH I stuck with track very long this year 
Avnoor Deol: Next yr track atmosphere is gonna be so dead

Avnoor Deol: I mean 
Michael Lu: He has unfortunately got very bad rep 
Avnoor Deol: on the one hand wait rly how for what reason ? 
Michael Lu: Ppl think heâs to showy and somewhat cringe Like imagine nick langel 
Avnoor Deol: After the ð² ð² ð² he has seemed very uh 
Michael Lu: Lol heâs had the room to explore Might makes right 
Avnoor Deol: Unique What abt nick Langel or are u using him as example 
Michael Lu: Imagine nick langel on one spectrum of smart ppl Imagine the virgin b Cho on the other side Ethan Wang leapt from the middle past nick langel into yonder 
Avnoor Deol: uh idk what that means 
Michael Lu: He went too far past the classy sexy smart finish line 
Avnoor Deol: o yea ok Heâs an individual indeed 
Michael Lu: And ppl think he is Dickish with what he did for college Personally I donât mind 
Avnoor Deol: What he do for college ?? like 
Michael Lu: I think heâs good man mostly He got into Stanford Committed 
Avnoor Deol: So just because he got in? 
Michael Lu: Wears merch and shit 
Avnoor Deol: oh I mean 
Michael Lu: But still applies to other college 
Avnoor Deol: thatâs acceptable cockiness 
Michael Lu: ^main reason 
Avnoor Deol: to an extent 
Michael Lu: No itâs not rlly the gear Itâs more of the fact he committed But still applies to top schools for lols 
Avnoor Deol: what tf does that mean Ohh ohhh Ohh thatâs actually dickish tho 
Michael Lu: Kind of but you should get used to it Someone in ur grade would do it U clout thirsty cunts lol 
Avnoor Deol: I mean itâs not like heâs actually âtaking peoples spotâ which is he main opposition uh idk I lose faith in my grade Ppl in my chem constantly talk about college Not namin names but like 
Michael Lu: Donât listen to em 
Avnoor Deol: They talk about GPA required for valedictorian 
Michael Lu: Most of it is bull shit 98 
Avnoor Deol: itâs really annoying sometimes âMy mom wonât let me go to Texas unless itâs Riceâ Thanks for that information 
Michael Lu: TBH You donât even need to go to a good school 
Avnoor Deol: Yea but brainwashing 
Michael Lu: Most ppl end up wit the same salary and job 
Avnoor Deol: Has led me to believe so 
Michael Lu: Regardless of college 
Avnoor Deol: Yep 
Michael Lu: Well u just get a better environment at better schools Like smarter ppl 
Avnoor Deol: As long as itâs semi respectable non community college I guess 
Michael Lu: More alumni 
Avnoor Deol: Nah elitist schools probably more toxic environment 
Michael Lu: Go to college for the environment not the. Clout Lol stfu ur prob still gonna apply to them anyways lol 
Avnoor Deol: I picture schools like Princeton as full of ppl like that narwhal man But white Ofc I am I confirm Conform 
Michael Lu: Well Ivy League schools actually hate virgins Itâs called affirmative action + personality rating 
Avnoor Deol: Uh ok Rip brain 
Michael Lu: Yeah idk bout him Just a heads up Donât get cocky like him 
Avnoor Deol: Btw did wyan get waitlist from mit 
Michael Lu: (also donât tell Brian or ethan or anyone about my advice tryin to help u) 
Avnoor Deol: Brian is a unique beast 
Michael Lu: Wyan got deferred 
Avnoor Deol: yea ik or yea deferred thatâs what. Meant 
Michael Lu: Heâs the epitome Of dedicated research and completion 
Avnoor Deol: Brian went up to me in the halls and said he got into norhwhatever Western or eastern 
Michael Lu: Shorty yield 
Avnoor Deol: Whichever 
Michael Lu: Shitty He did 
Avnoor Deol: Which one 
Michael Lu: Yeah he needs attention or something Lol wyan B Cho was actually decent academic man until junior year When his intellectual penis erected forever 
Avnoor Deol: Wdym by decent academic man like good grades or humble studious man 
Michael Lu: Pretty humble Hardworking 
Avnoor Deol: So then he became loud obnoxious laughy man 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Avnoor Deol: Tears to laughter real quick 
Michael Lu: Itâs a common lesson sir With both ethan Brian Me when I was young Knowledge is a burden 
Avnoor Deol: youngER 
Michael Lu: A power than can corrupt the soul 
Avnoor Deol: Wait knowledge of what 
Michael Lu: Just being a smart person 
Avnoor Deol: O 
Michael Lu: Makes u more prone to being a duck Dick Or being seen as a dick 
Avnoor Deol: Hard agree Very hard agree actually 
Michael Lu: Thatâs why Iâve been so fatuous with youtbe and videos Also I donât share college shit with anyone And everyone in my firehouse thinks Iâm going to stony brook Because smart people Are bourgeois elistst pricks 
Avnoor Deol: so ur trying to blend in like a halligan man 
Michael Lu: Yes 
Avnoor Deol: And not draw attention 
Michael Lu: TBH 
Avnoor Deol: Noble 
Michael Lu: Thereâs so much more you find in life When u blend in with regular social people 
Avnoor Deol: U doing TBH in all caps bothers me btw 
Michael Lu: Iâve enjoyed firefighting. So much because the community is more genuine 
Avnoor Deol: I can attest to that 
Michael Lu: Not Harvard Princeton assholes but SUNY folk 
Avnoor Deol: Iâm scared of culture shock after HS 
Michael Lu: Local gentlemen with great character and social skills Wdym culture shock 
Avnoor Deol: like Iâve been grown in this GNS environment And when I get plopped into the real world 
Michael Lu: Oh lol yeah 
Avnoor Deol: yea 
Michael Lu: Itâll get worse if u go to elite school 
Avnoor Deol: God diggity dayum 
Michael Lu: I mean if u live all ur life like a middle class man Youâll never experience the other half and youâll be fine I guess But ur right GN is strange place 
Avnoor Deol: I feel like in college Iâll end up being like a hermit 
Michael Lu: In city school kids shank each other lol ð¤ 
Avnoor Deol: like the only reason I socialize is probably because I see ppl 5 days a week and am forced to interact 
Michael Lu: Itâs fine to be an introvert 
Avnoor Deol: And then when I leave Iâll realize I only talked to ppl because I dealt with them 5 days a week 
Michael Lu: Just have good social skill when necessary 
Avnoor Deol: I know thereâs like a diff between introvert and antisocial but I donât know what it is 
Michael Lu: Thatâs what my dad is like 
Avnoor Deol: itâs like 
Michael Lu: I think itâs a bit nuanced 
Avnoor Deol: I am fine with talking to ppl and like socializing but it doesnât mean I like it when people try and talk to me 
Michael Lu: Both are abt ppl who prefer to be alone or can survive being alone But antisocial implies inability to be social 
Avnoor Deol: I can very easily adapt but I prefer not 
Michael Lu: Yeah thatâs introvert 
Avnoor Deol: Oh ok gotchu makes sense 
Michael Lu: I think Social skills are a must 
Avnoor Deol: yea 
Michael Lu: But association is a choice 
Avnoor Deol: Like Iâm a very talkative person 
Michael Lu: IMO 
Avnoor Deol: actually This year Iâve been quite reserved Like First time teachers have ever told me I donât participate lol I just realize how annoying I can be when I participate Like last year I was a bit of a dickwad in English and soc And this year I am nospeak 
Michael Lu: FaddÃ¨ Well 1st period 
Avnoor Deol: Fadde knows I just choose not to talk He only calls on me when he needs someone to read out loud Cuz I donât have 2 decibel voice This year soc is also like itâs like the subject Iâm best at but itâs not my highest grade class and I get ticked off that Iâm not in Ko with mega boosted curve because I have like Superiority complex And feel the need to flex on others in the one area Iâm able to flex lolll sounds bad Ik 
Michael Lu: Youâll learn to deal with it Like ima sure Ethan and Brian will eventually learn To be normal human beings In terms of humility 
Avnoor Deol: I picture Brian remaining with like A GNS-esque crowd 
Michael Lu: Lol one that ridiculed him? 
Avnoor Deol: Brian seems to fit in well with like idk Like wherever Brian goes Heâll associate with the asian folk there Cuz he seems to genuinely enjoy like 
Michael Lu: Weeev 
Avnoor Deol: Table tennis and like cultural heritage and like 
Michael Lu: Weâve Weeeebw 
Avnoor Deol: He wants to be club volleyball Ethan idk 
Michael Lu: Interest Etha will just do weights lol 
Avnoor Deol: Ethan canât physically get big enough

Avnoor Deol: next year i have nobody to talk to kareem austin and the rest keep shit interesting 
Michael Lu: Seems like youâve taken the initiative to cleanse the team of some folk 
Avnoor Deol: not my fault kareem hazed chris lum off forced him out of his locker and took $20 from him lol 
Michael Lu: Dam Rip 
Avnoor Deol: next year i have nobody to talk to 
Michael Lu: Spencer 
Avnoor Deol: spencer and timo exclusively but i donât rly talk to spencer the way i would w kareem 
Michael Lu: What abt the little kids below u 
Avnoor Deol: and austin and richard etc i hate most of em 
Michael Lu: Lmao 
Avnoor Deol: the current sophs tjat arent bad are quiet like rick and alex su wu* the freshmen are the most god awful class there are so many genuine retards in the class of 2024 23* one indian kid whoâs mentally retarded, one whoâs socially crippled and probably on the verge of suicide one kid whoâs 4â11 and wears military merch exclusively but heâs kinda funny and the super fast kid whoâs cocky af alan gu 18:23 5k freshman kinda nutty damn iâm back to my big wall of texts lol 
Michael Lu: The fuck Thatâs stolen valor who the fuck is this mother fucker Dam 
Avnoor Deol: he wants to go Navy tho so itâs chill his dad in i think 
Michael Lu: Ok respect 
Avnoor Deol: heâs quite funny too but heâs tiny 
Michael Lu: Small boi 
Avnoor Deol: he does navy camp stuff i think but sometimes he wears army merch and we all ??? 
Michael Lu: Ok heâs âmotivatedâ 
Avnoor Deol: and then one day he came in with no military merch and was wearing all LSU stuff and said he wanted to go there because his dad said military was not a good career path and then he reverted back heâs also p good for a freshman he ran like 20:00 in cross 
Michael Lu: Ok heâs a freshman donât listen to him for career advice 
Avnoor Deol: i donât talk about these two retards wanna talk* yea so thatâs why current underclassmen are unspeakable to timo is not one to contribute much to discussion/is quiet and heâs also slower so i have spencer exclusively that sucks 
Michael Lu: Oof Youâd make a great co captain kid 
Avnoor Deol: bruh iâm the one and only 
Michael Lu: Who is speedier 
Avnoor Deol: spencers fake as shit when he talks to them spencer still faster in everything but i closed the gap hard we trade 50/50 races now instead of like 90/10 
Michael Lu: Interesting 
Avnoor Deol: is it tho as time goes on spencer is becoming more and more like my brian cho like spencer is to me what brian is to u 
Michael Lu: What lol What did u think abt Brian Why u comparing the two 
Avnoor Deol: theyâre quite similar ish 
Michael Lu: Maybe They are very overzealous 
Avnoor Deol: like i realized last year i hayes brian hated* and spencer is similar but i donât hate him i just do not enjoy talking to him 
Michael Lu: Interesting 
Avnoor Deol: heâs not quite as annoyingly go-lucky and oafy as brian but both of em have hella annoying mood swings and both are simps 
Michael Lu: Oof ð« Well get corona Scuffed Big oof

Avnoor Deol: iâm still the same person for the most part i just associate less with rtards so my personality on my own doesnât seem as negative 
Michael Lu: Good good 
Avnoor Deol: bery good but the problem then becomes i have nobody to talk to if i cut ties with ppl like spencer as well as the brandon huangâs of the world 
Michael Lu: Lol that was me when I disassociated with the communist quiz bowl kids

Michael Lu: Lol ok 
Avnoor Deol: mhm basically spencer is my middle ground to the female population ð«

Conversation:
Ben Kobliner: "Is acting showing who you are if you're acting?" Lol that's exactly what i was thinking 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Hey Ben, can you tell me a bit about the fire department junior volunteer service? 1. The application process 2. Responsibilities 3. Hours and days for commitment (particularly over the summer) 4. Is this community service? A job? Etc? Thanks Ben! See you in Detroit! 
Ben Kobliner: Yeah sure Is this for robotics? The reason why youâre asking will determine how honest I can be lol 
Michael Lu: No in general Not considering robotics 
Ben Kobliner: Oh ok Are you interested in joining? 
Michael Lu: Depends on the information. 
Ben Kobliner: Ok how old are you and what part of great Neck do you live in? 1) you basically just fill out a packet with basic info about yourself and attach a medical exam or get a signature from your doctor. Then the junior firefighters vote yes or no to determine whether you can join. Not hard at all to join. 
2) responsibilities: 1 drill (hands on training) and 1 meeting per month. 630-9ish every other Monday 2) There are also special events a few times per year like the Memorial Day parade, the great neck street fair, fire department open house, etc. These are usually optional. 

Attendance for drills and meetings is supposed to be mandatory, but if you have a valid excuse itâs fine if youâre not there. Having a lot of homework is considered a valid excuse. If you show up to more than 75% of things, youâre fine Summer is the same thing. A few kids (like me and Ryan Motch) have chosen to go to a 2 week day camp at the Nassau fire academy. I guess it counts as community service because they do some fire safety education for young kids and stuff like that. You can actually get GNSHS internship credit for it Hereâs my honest overall take on it:

Back in the day (were talking when Motch was a teenager and Squeegee was in his 20s) up until maybe 5 years ago, the junior firefighters were all really motivated kids who were highly respected by actual firefighters. They did serious training and were unofficially allowed to help out at fires. Most of them went on to become volunteer firefighters, and became successful cops, teachers, businesspeople, engineers, etc But recently the kids who join tend to be less serious. A lot of them are immature. Itâs sad because the training they do is great. They get to train in a simulator that uses real fire in a controlled way. They get to use rescue tools to cut apart real cars. Iâm assuming youâre 16 or 17. The age range of junior firefighters is 12-17.  Minimum age to be a legit firefighter or EMT is 17.  If youâre interested in being a volunteer firefighter/EMT, Iâd say you should forget about the junior program and just decide if you want to join one of the fire departments ^thats a lot of info that I dumped on you lol. Itâs a topic that Iâve put a lot of thought into You can call me for a better explanation if you want (516) 493-0705 
Michael Lu: Okay, thanks Ben! 
Ben Kobliner: Yeah no prob. Are you interested in joining the fire department, or are you mainly looking at the program as a good way to get involved with community service? 
Michael Lu: The former Option 
Ben Kobliner: Ok cool. Fire, medical, or both? 
Michael Lu: Fire I suppose, I have to figure out if it can work into my schedule though. 
Ben Kobliner: Yeah thatâs awesome. Ive found that the time is definitely worth it. Itâs enjoyable, and itâs also a very unique and rewarding experience for a 17 year old to have. The time commitment isnât bad. I know a few kids who volunteer in addition to being full time college students with part time jobs How long have u been interested? 
Michael Lu: After working there during build season 
Ben Kobliner: Yeah if you have any questions about it, let me know. I also know that Kevin (and I think Kenneth) tan are in the Manhasset Lakeville Fire Dept ambulance unit, so if youre friends with them you could get their perspective too. 
Michael Lu: Alright cool ð Thanks! 
Ben Kobliner: Of course. Thanks for reaching out See you in Detroit

Michael Lu: I am back I saved my towel from yesterday 


Conversation:
Ben Kobliner: Howâs the fire department so far? 
Michael Lu: Haha good they havenât actually sworn me in so I canât go on calls But Iâm in the company So I go to trainings 
Ben Kobliner: Is there a certain amount of time you have to wait before you can go to calls? Or you just have to get sworn in? 
Michael Lu: Sworn in Provides are allowed on calls usually But are not given priority for spots in the truck Probies* 
Ben Kobliner: Yeah same for us kind of Itâs rare for there to not be enough spots Most volunteer departments are lucky if they get 4 or 5 guys on the truck for a call. Usually 8 seats The only time they fill up is for actual fires 
Michael Lu: Is this Alertv Or another one at Brown? 
Ben Kobliner: Alert Theyâre really laid bad, kind of in a bad way You can go inside a fire pretty much right away 
Michael Lu: Without like SCBA cert? 
Ben Kobliner: The thing is we donât even do SCBA certification or anything like that They just teach you and itâs kind of up to you to know what youâre capable of But the MLFD seems a lot more organized Thereâs a lot of stuff that could be improved but overall itâs a really good thing to be a firefighter Just learn as much as you can and use common sense. Youâll do well And youâre gonna love it 
Michael Lu: Yepppppp Itâs great fun already! 
Ben Kobliner: Is anyone else from south your year a firefighter or EMT 
Michael Lu: Kenneth Tan - EMT Jaymin Choi - firefighter James Kessler is probably a firefighter at alert? Katelyn Lee - EMT 
Ben Kobliner: Wow so thereâs a good amount. Yeah Kessler is at Alert. Heâs a character. What company is Jaymin? 
Michael Lu: With me at Co 3 
Ben Kobliner: Nice And you share the firehouse with co 6 so you see the EMTs too 
Michael Lu: Yup 
Ben Kobliner: What drills/training have you done so far 
Michael Lu: Forcible entry Hydrant Donning I watched from a far some breaking open a car stuff Also they do engineering every weekend which is basically checking and testing the equipment engines and rescue trucks Helps me learn about all the stuff 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Do alerts use the SCM MRS app? Or is it just listening to a pager? 
Ben Kobliner: We use that app And get texts thru the app The app hasnât been working recently though It sends notifications but the app crashes when you open it 
Michael Lu: Oh Is this for everyone in your company? 
Ben Kobliner: Probably. Theyve been having issues with the whole system For a few days it didnât even send push notifications which was bad lol 
Michael Lu: Ouch 


Conversation:
Ben Kobliner: Do you know what your intended major is yet? 
Michael Lu: Lol nope Not in college yet 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: You went to the buff show? 
Ben Kobliner: Yeah went with David Oginski Iâm back until Tuesday morning Any robotics over the next couple days? 
Michael Lu: Yep weâre at alerts until Tuesday Tmrw at 2 pm Stop by but donât tell anyone Mainly to prevent certain team members from finding out and coming 
Ben Kobliner: Nice Busy tomorrow but Iâll be there Monday 


Conversation:
Ben Kobliner: What time today 
Michael Lu: Haha right now till whenever 


Conversation:
Ben Kobliner: Were you at the 10? Niceee Which rig were u on 
Michael Lu: 8735 engine A lot of companies came including alerts 
Ben Kobliner: What position were you 
Michael Lu: Lol I set up a ladder Then couldnât do much because there were so many people there already 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Just wondering Is Kessler actually active in Alerts? Does he respond to a lot of calls? 


Conversation:
Ben Kobliner: My bad just saw this I asked him last night how many calls heâs been to since June â3 to 5â He also never comes to drills He claims shotput takes up all his time but thatâs obviously not an excuse for never showing up to anything 
Michael Lu: Oh lol 


Conversation:
Ben Kobliner: How long after you joined were you allowed to wear a pack and go inside 
Michael Lu: Havenât gone/been allowed to go inside yet haha 
Ben Kobliner: What about automatic alarms and stuff Not fires 
Michael Lu: Oh Yeah I go inside automatic alarms 
Ben Kobliner: You mentioned something a while ago about being SCBA certified Is that required to wear SCBA at routine calls 
Michael Lu: I think itâs for actual fires (I still put a pack on for automatic alarms) TBH tho they might not notice whether I go into a fire with a pack Depends on the officers order 
Ben Kobliner: David Oginski was originally going to join alert but now heâs going to join Co 4 Iâm trying to convince him not to Any downsides youâve noticed would be appreciated Lol Heâs mainly interested in the tight knit group they have at 4s. Theyâre always hanging out at the firehouse ready to go.  Theyâre also really enthusiastic and aggressive relative to other departments Iâm trying to explain to him that he has to think long term vs short term.  Volunteer departments fluctuate.  If a bunch of committed guys join at the same time, of course theyâre all going to hang out a lot.  But in 5 years theyâre going to lose interest and spend less time at the firehouse.  He should care more about long term structural factors rather than focusing on things that will change every few years 
Michael Lu: Well MLFD co 4 gets the most calls I guess So heâd lose sleep Also Idk if this is just my company But yeah a lot of ppl never show up to company stuf Sometimes we donât even get a rig out Also for MLFD getting off probation is really long And Probies get a lot of grunt work 
Ben Kobliner: Is the training well organized, or is it kind of random 
Michael Lu: Every Sunday Pretty organized 
Ben Kobliner: Yeah honestly it sounds like heâd like it there He would enjoy having more calls And the grunt work stuff heâd view as an important part of earning your place 
Michael Lu: I thought heâs going for FDNY 
Ben Kobliner: He is, but heâs still going to be a volunteer 
Michael Lu: I see 
Ben Kobliner: You canât be a firefighter in the FDNY until youâre 21 Heâs doing FDNY EMS at 19 And then switching into fire 
Michael Lu: Sounds cool 
Ben Kobliner: Yeah 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Newman can you put me on the CAD group instead of the scouting group? Thanks. 
Ben Newman: Sure 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Are you good with motor physics? Can you check some calculations? 
Ben Newman: Um Sure I can try The math and physics work out What are you making? 
Michael Lu: Cheap hover board Does the motor torque actually make sense? Is the sole purpose for torque to overcome friction? 
Ben Newman: Well not exactly I don't think 
Michael Lu: Does it affect acceleration? 
Ben Newman: I think the motor provides a torque to the inside of the wheel and the friction's torque acts against that torque moving the wheel Yeah I think it would affect acceleration 
Michael Lu: But is 2.2 kgcm torque enough? 
Ben Newman: I don't know enough about motors and what you're doing to say 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Hey Newman, what was doing USACO like? Were the problems very difficult and was it easy to place? 
Ben Newman: So there are four levels. Bronze was really entry level stuff. Silver is the level where  you can get a lot of the problems . Gold you might get one problem right and Platinum is impossible It really depends at how comfortable you are with algorithms USACO training has some sample problems grouped by technique and you can look at the previous olympiads to get a feel for their difficulty 
Michael Lu: Okay, thanks! Do you remember where you placed the input and output text files so that your program could read and write to them? 
Ben Newman: When your testing locally they just have to be in the same directory as your program. 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: What IDE and language did you use? 
Ben Newman: So I started out using Java and I just used TextWrangler (you could probably use sublime text) You don't really need an IDE 
Michael Lu: okay, because I'm using eclipse and it's really being a pain. 
Ben Newman: Yeah I can imagine What's the problem? 
Michael Lu: The "classic" works on my machine but not the online grader. 
Ben Newman: Do you have a package statement? That might be messing something up 
Michael Lu: yeah, i commented out all the stuff eclipse required so the code is compatible with USACO They are pointing out a bug about a string index being out of bounds 
Ben Newman: What does the top of your file look like? Does it start with the  multiline comment with your ID, language and task? 
Michael Lu: yep 
Ben Newman: Does the code compile on USACO's online grader? If it does do any of the test cases work or does the first one cause the error? 
Michael Lu: Oh okay nevermind 
Ben Newman: You found the problem? 
Michael Lu: yeah. Thanks for the help though :) 
Ben Newman: Ok good no problem 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: tragic 
Ben Newman: Ugh...so close That's when you just check for that input in a conditional... 
Michael Lu: yep 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Hey Ben, long time since we talked. Iâm under the stress of college apps rn. Xd Could u give me some tips abt writing the common app essay? 
Ben Newman: Hey Michael! Good to hear from you! I hope your senior year isnât too painful. Hmm so as for advice, I guess Iâd say the important part of a common app is that it genuinely displays who you are. Try to put yourself on paper and think about which aspect(s) of your identity you want to shine through. Thereâs plenty of room in most individual school apps to write about other aspects that donât make it into your common app. I also doubt that thereâs any one thing any admissions office is looking for, so itâs not really worth playing the whole âwhat I think they want to seeâ game. (The other benefit of this approach is that if you write your true self down, and they read and are like ânahâ then thatâs probably not a place youâd be happy at anyway.) More concretely, I found it useful to write a few different drafts (or just paragraphs) about different topics and then just choose to develop the one or two I liked best and wanted to write about. And look, this whole process is a giant stressful crapshoot, and youâre as qualified as anyone else applying, so a lot of this stuff comes down to luck at a certain point. Iâm sure youâre going to keep on doing awesome things wherever you end up going, so best of luck with the apps (second semester is closer than it feels :) )! If you have any other questions about applying in general or about Stanford specifically, just let me know! 
Michael Lu: Thx Newman, I hope u donât mind if I ask u more questions in the future!

Michael Lu: I was kinda pissed off Bc ppl keep bugging me at GNS For my college list And what colleges I get into Like I got 10 messages/calls at 6:28 pm And I needed some breathing room Also donât like ppl posting on my timeline abt college shit Idk maybe it was my bad lying But GNS seniors and colleges are so cancer Anyways How did u get to CPW last year 
Cindy Wang: ah i see honestly best thing i learned in hs is to give no shits about what other people think and just do what u want lol i took the amtrak to south station! you can then take the T to MIT from there 
Michael Lu: What T 
Cindy Wang: subway red line T to MIT/kendall alternatively u could just uber from the station or just have your parents drive u also i highkey forgot what your first name is

Cindy Wang: ah lmao well mit is great but it also sucks ass rn but u should still come 
Michael Lu: lol waddup wit dat doe 
Cindy Wang: lol what up with what 
Michael Lu: Why it sucks rn 
Cindy Wang: ohh i mean itâs just really hard and a lot to keep up with especially freshmen spring cuz iâm taking kind of a heavy course load, and itâs just a lot different from high school work wise but even tho itâs hard, iâm grateful for it cuz mit rly breaks u down and u come out better 
Michael Lu: Yah 
Cindy Wang: LOL im sitting next to annie rn and seeing ur messages lmao 
Michael Lu: Cool tell Annie I said hi! 
Cindy Wang: yo mis is great come thru *mit 
Michael Lu: Oke !!! 
Cindy Wang: not gns 2.0 ya lmao lmk if u wanna talk abt it 
Michael Lu: Yep thx Cindy! Does AP French score count? 
Cindy Wang: yup you have to get a 5 
Michael Lu: Oh And then what if I do (But thatâs def not happening lol) 
Cindy Wang: lmao pretty sure no one my year got a 5 if u get a 5 on any non STEM AP, it counts for 9 units of unrestricted elective credit (most classes are 12 units) and thts useful if u want to do early sophomore standing as a second semester freshman 
Michael Lu: Lol whatâs that ð¤ 
Cindy Wang: second semester freshmen have a credit limit of 57 units but if u have early soph standing thereâs no limit and u also declare ur major and get an advisor in your major pretty much most useful if u want to take a lot of classes in the spring but also unnecessary cuz iâm at 54 units and already dying 
Michael Lu: O Oke

Daniel Lu: I'll copy paste Hello everyone(comrades), my name is Daniel Lu, and I am on this stage running to hopefully be your next student body president. 
My counterparts on this stage all(seemingly) share the same good intentions and goals for the betterment of this school. I am (hopefully) here for the same reasons, and my ambition is to listen and act upon the needs of the people.. Leadership qualities are of utmost importance, and I believe to possess them myself. I am confident that I will strive to fulfill the needs of the student body by becoming your next president.  Based on these declarations, what I seek to achieve can only be described as a work in progress. What I can promise however, are not impractical fantasies(unfortunately too widespread), but to implement an agenda in the sense of the same hard work and dedication of previous student governments. With all this being said, remember to cast your ballot for Daniel Kaifeng Lu as your next student body president. I ventured off track tho As in plenty of places 
Michael Lu: okay, thanks. 
Daniel Lu: Kek 
Michael Lu: May I post your speech with subtitles in group? 
Daniel Lu: ._. Cringe Sure 
Michael Lu: Ur speech not mine Do you mind if I submit a version with background music? 
Daniel Lu: Background music 
Michael Lu: Yes Also am I free to distribute the speech within the close friend group (i.e. William, Sam, Ethan, Justin, Sammy)

Daniel Lu: Yea 
Michael Lu: How long are classes? 
Daniel Lu: Three sessions in one day About 2-3 hours same class. 
Michael Lu: 2 - 3 hours per class? 
Daniel Lu: There is one course where there are three distinct times of instruction Each 2-3 hours 
Michael Lu: so 3 sessions (2 - 3 hours) for one subject? 
Daniel Lu: It's the same subject You select one thing 
Michael Lu: Okay, what time does it start? What time does it end?

Michael Lu: so there is some intermission between the 2nd and 3rd session??? 
Daniel Lu: Of course. There are activities And there is dinner 
Michael Lu: are there exams/homework assignments?

Daniel Lu: The same length. 
Michael Lu: 3 sessions on sunday or just 1 evening session?

Michael Lu: So you were being sarcastic in those emojis?

Michael Lu: Haha lol Daniel, your response to the  school walkout elicited a counter argument of typos and logical fallacies XD 
Daniel Lu: Hue Ima reply 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Daniel Lu: Wait someone else got 16 reactions by shitting on everyone who mocked the post 
Michael Lu: Theyâre popular And of course the silly on the fence argument would attract both sides 
Daniel Lu: I wonât make an argument though Iâm gonna poke them on their lack of real commitment I doubt any of them will actually go through with this walkout 
Michael Lu: They need the administrations approval, or else there will be repercussions. If there are repercussions, nobody/few will participate. 
Daniel Lu: Heh But should I say this though 
Michael Lu: Freedom of speech But youâll get a lot of hate. Because the counters to skeptics are very popular ppl. But yeah, Angelina Liu hasnât accounted for the fact that social change has usually resulted for practical reason. 
Daniel Lu: Sheâs not alone Droves of people will come to her defense 
Michael Lu: Yeah, some people support her ideas and some people support her as a person. Thereâs an underlying distortion of reason due to personal preferences. I donât think they realize how little has been done to national gun laws after Columbine or Sandy Hook... 
Daniel Lu: How little? More like nothing at all 
Michael Lu: Yeah lol 
Daniel Lu: 170 shootings later and no one really cares Thereâs that one week of sentimental bs 
Michael Lu: The problem is that these people havenât been doing research. 
Daniel Lu: And then everyone goes back to normal 
Michael Lu: Yeah, unfortunately this incident will be forgotten soon. 
Daniel Lu: Because itâs not cool anymore to show concern for people America! 
Michael Lu: Political power comes from the wallet or the gun, seldom from the mouth. 
Daniel Lu: If the mouth is backed up by the wallet And the gun It works too 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Daniel Lu: Ok Ima go dare them to actually get permission And goad then into actually carrying it out Them 
Michael Lu: Yeah, most students participate in walkouts to cut class, unfortunately. Or in Great Neck people donât care at all. 
Daniel Lu: Shit Shiiiiit Wait I would want the second option on that day Since itâll make the walkout people look stupid When they realize absolutely no one else cares 
Michael Lu: Yeah, itâs a political bubble issue. 
Daniel Lu: And itâs currently trendy to express concern 
Michael Lu: Particularly strong in Great Neck. Yeah people are experiencing a wave of idealism. 
Daniel Lu: âIf you keep up this âhow could we make a differenceâ attitude, youâre gonna lead a pretty insignificant and, quite frankly, sad life. Did it escape your knowledge that there have been over 170 school shootings since the Columbine High School incident in 1999? Which, by the way, is the inspiration for this idea in case you were unaware of that as well. Letâs start with the basics. The Boston Tea Party. Maybe youâve heard of it? Far be it for a small British company to stand up to a world power, right? Well look where we are now sweetie. How about the Seneca Falls Convention, in which 200 women convened and produced the âDeclaration of Sentiments and Grievances.â The public thought this was ridiculous but whaddya know, in the following years, the 19th amendment was passed! Donât worry, weâll keep this list short and simple for those of you who donât pay attention in social studies. On August 28, 1963, over 200,000 protestors gathered at Washington D.C., marching from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial. And what were they doing? Simply marching, taking a stand, proving you can send a message without violence. No Iâm not sure if youâve heard of this guy, we have an assembly dedicated to him and an entire day, but Martin Luther King Jr.? Yea, hopefully that rings a bell. Do you think his actions made a difference? Letâs give you the benefit of the doubt and say you answered âyes.â My point is, America is built off of speaking out. You think weâd be in this same society had everyone just thought âhmm, well I guess we could say something right? Nah letâs just chill my dudes, what good could that do.â Eh probably not, right? You donât want to march? You do you buddy. But maybe if you could get off of your $2000 gaming chair, you might do something worthwhile. Maybe you havenât been directly affected by this heinous crimes, but so many others have been. Donât be fooled by the Great Neck bubble we live in. This is real and itâs destroying thousands of families. These families have to plan funerals for teenagers who had showed up for school, seeking an education. Donât come after Camryn just because sheâs willing to try. I get it. You have nothing to do this break, but get off your high horse.â Oh shit it was that long No wonder why it took me so much time to sift through that 
Michael Lu: Yep and replete with historical and logical fallacies. 
Daniel Lu: Ima dissect it in a short summary 
Michael Lu: I read it, 
Daniel Lu: Hue 
Michael Lu: Iâd say Ben Kobliners was better. 
Daniel Lu: Didnât like his either But not as bad 
Michael Lu: But none are really a solid counter argument. 
Daniel Lu: Therefore I will take the risk and send a reply 
Michael Lu: Keep it short 
Daniel Lu: Yes 
Michael Lu: And logically/historically accurate 
Daniel Lu: No need to make it historical 
Michael Lu: Whoâs Michael Apollo â the Conservative Russian sympathizer? 
Daniel Lu: Sophomore Trump supporter Changes profile picture every few minutes 
Michael Lu: Do you know him personally? 
Daniel Lu: Nope I see his posts often though Since he posts way too much 
Michael Lu: Is he actually a Trump supporter? Or is he an internet troll? 
Daniel Lu: Hard to tell He may be legit 
Michael Lu: It seems like his Facebook serves solely for sparking politically-related arguments. In this case, then it can be hilarious occasionally. 
Daniel Lu: Hehe Should I do it 
Michael Lu: A bit sarcastic/patronizing 
Daniel Lu: ._. 
Michael Lu: Not that thereâs anything wrong with that, considering her post. 
Daniel Lu: Itâs really tempting to tho 
Michael Lu: Lol

David Yao: ? 
Michael Lu: GOA GPA 
David Yao: we dont do weighted buddy only unweighted cry 
Michael Lu: FUQ 
David Yao: our school sucks dick lmao 
Michael Lu: Lol k 
David Yao: multiply your gpa by 0.08 
Michael Lu: Do I have to go to an online calculator then 
David Yao: and that should be your wiehgted or was it 0.06 anyway 
Michael Lu: Umm That drops me down to a GPA < 10 Wdym 
David Yao: i mean 1.06 
Michael Lu: That boosts the GPA? 
David Yao: no like if our school had wiehgted gpa 
Michael Lu: Give an example using Kimberlyâs high ass GPA how would she do it 
David Yao: your weighted would be 1.06x your current gpa i think she has a 98.3 she would have a 104.2 if weighted 
Michael Lu: Wait what 
David Yao: or she might have a 106.16 depending on which factor you use 
Michael Lu: Is weighted out of 5 
David Yao: no still out of 4 but our school does do 4 or 5 doesnt* our school is unweighted out of 100 
Michael Lu: So itâs out of 5? For weighted Like colleges make it outta 5? 
David Yao: no its still out of 4 so you would have a 4.1 4.2 4.3 
Michael Lu: 4.9999999? 
David Yao: some high schools go by a 5 scale thats a 5 
Michael Lu: Fuq it Iâm making it up bud 
David Yao: 4.9999999999 LOL 
Michael Lu: Ima guess my weighted GPA 
David Yao: just take your current gpa 100 and divide by 4 not sure if that is the correct way to convert it but thats the most logical sense to me 
Michael Lu: What would u say my weighted is David? Ima calculate my weighted GOA via the David Equation Pick a decimal between 3 - 5 
David Yao: probably a 7 idk what is your real gpa if you dont mind sharing 
Michael Lu: Around 4.0 unweighted 
David Yao: ... give me that number out of 100 4.0 means nothing 
Michael Lu: Umm if u promise 
David Yao: im just gonna assume 97 alright 
Michael Lu: To deadass not share Like with anybody 
David Yao: dude im just gonna say its a 97 
Michael Lu: 98.8 
David Yao: now dont worry jesus christ 
Michael Lu: 98.75 
David Yao: LOL anyway val your gpa is a 4.0 and if weighted it would be like a 107 
Michael Lu: Are you sure it can go over 100? 
David Yao: yeah many schools go over 100 why do you need weighted tho most places like unweighted like the legit places bc thats without bullshit are you applying to some program 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
David Yao: i think a 98.8 is more than enough just say 4.0 
Michael Lu: Weighted tho? 
David Yao: unweighted 
Michael Lu: Do they want it out of 5? 
David Yao: no tell them its unweighted and honestly 
Michael Lu: I canât Thereâs a box for weighted GOA GOA 
David Yao: is it require 100% 
Michael Lu: Doesnât specify 
David Yao: can you email or call the program director or person in charge of admissions 
Michael Lu: Maybe 
David Yao: i think that would be the best way to firgure stuff out 
Michael Lu: Well whatâs my weighted out of 5 bud? 
David Yao: or talk with your guidance counselor at school and ask them what you should do 
Michael Lu: Guess using the David equation? 
David Yao: multiply by 1.08 and then divide by 20 5.33 
Michael Lu: Aight thx man 
David Yao: dont take my word for it tho schools do it differently so watch out 
Michael Lu: Lol 
David Yao: i might just be a blind man leading you to your doom lol the person in charge of admissions be lile wtf 
Michael Lu: Lmao nah David sees all 
David Yao: 5.33? who is this guy? automatic in 
Michael Lu: Iâm just putting down like 4.7 or 4.8 You know Cause Tria and Graham 
David Yao: lol i think you should just put a solid 5.0 
Michael Lu: Lol itâs gotta be somewhat realistic man 
David Yao: dude just show them your gpa out of 100 if they question it 
Michael Lu: ð±ï¸ 
David Yao: alright dude best of luck EA harvard i see you 
Michael Lu: Thank you for the wisdom Messiah 
David Yao: lol do you have a school you want to you to you are definitely in range for anything top 8 and below like those are kinda guaranteed if you like uchig 
Michael Lu: Ik Asian boi 
David Yao: you can probably get in bc they dont care about essays they just want smart people 
Michael Lu: In Asian ð±ï¸* Tfw affirmative action tho 
David Yao: nah as long as sat over 1570 
Michael Lu: Asian STEM engineering = hit me like a truck 
David Yao: and gpa 98 
Michael Lu: Lol I donât have that SAT 
David Yao: feelsbadman 
Michael Lu: XD 
David Yao: well for other schools anything over 1530 is basically a 1600 its the same score range so idk man you can pretty much get into any school except the top 4 ivy and stanford and chig 
Michael Lu: Can SAT essay offset a bad English section score 
David Yao: if you have 98 and 1530 no english section is important gotta get that 730 but dont beat yourself over it if you dont 
Michael Lu: What if I have 750 but perfect essay Like what do 
David Yao: dont take it more than 3 times either dude 750 is good 1550 ? im assuming you got 800 math so 
Michael Lu: But like 1570 is better? 
David Yao: only for princeton hardvard stand mit chig 
Michael Lu: Welp lol exactly 
David Yao: etx idk man you wanna do engineering? 
Michael Lu: Maybe 
David Yao: stan mit 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
David Yao: thats all i gotta say 
Michael Lu: Lol ð aight 
David Yao: 770 
Michael Lu: Gotta get back on dat SAT grind then After APs

Michael Lu: Wdym 
Deep Datta: I'm talking like use ur imaginatiob out of scratch for the robot Either it be some type of controller 
Michael Lu: Yeah Iâd Motch can give us a good to go I can def make some arms out of cheap servos Like RC too and Iâll operate, you drive 
Deep Datta: I work at a computer engineering corporation with a few electrical engineers, making products from scratch Theres plenty of stuff we can make to improve the robot 
Michael Lu: Lol you do? What Corp 
Deep Datta: Vetra 
Michael Lu: Do you get paid? 
Deep Datta: Yes Paid internship 
Michael Lu: Yuhhhh 
Deep Datta: yah yeet

Deep Datta: Well robotics electrical is simple, it's just like legos Kevin taught last week And the manual says it all in like 20 pages 
Michael Lu: Thatâs FRC electrical 
Deep Datta: for real robotics u mean 
Michael Lu: Yeah like from scratch You prob can do it since you do so much with computer builds Yeah we just need mentors to approve 
Deep Datta: I honestly don't know too much, but it should be easy to get a hang off 
Michael Lu: Definitely 
Deep Datta: I've worked literally from printing pcb boards to filling them up Reflow ovens souldering in insane amounts That's all I did all summer lmao

Michael Lu: We donât fucking drive it We just put it on display 
Deep Datta: wait wait wait what do u want to do U wanted to drive it around in the gym right 
Michael Lu: We display your drive train no driving Now we canât But I add some servo arms For shits and giggles 
Deep Datta: Wait I asked if we could drive it inside 
Michael Lu: Well we canât 
Deep Datta: Yea not drive 
Michael Lu: But if we just put it on display 
Deep Datta: But I never asked about that 
Michael Lu: That you should ask 
Deep Datta: I will tmrw 
Michael Lu: Literally if we hook up this stuff to the robot Itâs harmless 
Deep Datta: Ah I see Yea should be no problem 
Michael Lu: But it looks better than representing robotics with n fucking robot No* 
Deep Datta: Mhm How strong are those motors btw 
Michael Lu: Not strong Cheap servos But if I skimp on weight 
Deep Datta: Mhm It should be fine then I'll ask tmrw 
Michael Lu: Iâll bring 
Deep Datta: mk

Michael Lu: Lol Sure can u tell me specifics tmrw At the meeting 
Deep Datta: yea I'll show you values and all the gearbox is gonna be shifting using dog gears 
Michael Lu: Ok cool ð 
Deep Datta: plates will be cadded and cnc cut 
Michael Lu: Yuh 
Deep Datta: That's around what we are working with To start, we are making a simple single speed gearbox tmrw to try this out before getting more complicated. We need this stuff cadded and we need to find the right metal and standoffs 
Michael Lu: Got it 
Deep Datta: On top of this, we need to figure out how to implement belts/chains 
Michael Lu: For a gearbox? 
Deep Datta: We are moving towards belts this year so that's going to be interested Interesting Yes 
Michael Lu: Chains in the gearbox?

You fall out of an airplane and grab a high voltage power line to top your fall. One hand or two, you will be fine, there ia no ground and no potential difference. However, if you reach for a nearby tree with one hand while holding the power line you are toast

Conversation:
Michael Lu: yo you need to run I can go with u today 
Eden Wang: Dude Ankle 
Michael Lu: boi 
Eden Wang: I don't want it to get worse 
Michael Lu: it doesn't get worse, it only get's worse when you pussy out and then try running again 
Eden Wang: No it gets better if I take a break 
Michael Lu: the exact thing happened to me first year yeah but then you basically restart your season after the break and then you try running again and you get injured 
Eden Wang: I'm gonna run over the weekend 
Michael Lu: nah b run today 
Eden Wang: I'm not gonna push it and get hurt even worse Dude I can't walk properly rn 
Michael Lu: ffffffssssss 
Eden Wang: I'd rather restart the season than keep running and not being able to run at all 
Michael Lu: then what happens when you restart the season and the same thing happens? 
Eden Wang: It shouldn't since I've gotten stronger since then I'm not gonna run with a messed up ankle Bad idea 
Michael Lu: okay but I did it freshman year and I never even went to the trainer's and I'm still fine 
Eden Wang: That was probably dumb Like dude You're asking an injured guy to run And not like a back injury or anything An ankle one 
Michael Lu: take a break if you want to, but if you gotta be consistent. when you start again 
Eden Wang: I'm going to be consistent when I'm back in shape But right now I'm not gonna 'push it' https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/6k920f/screw_dodge_ball_teach_our_youth_how_to_conquer/?st=J4J5YZHA&sh=d37bd56c

Conversation:
Eden Wang: I was reading a thread bout running on Reddit They said to start much slower and focus on distance So I'm probably gonna take some time on my own to improve before joining u guys 
Michael Lu: Or you could join us and run alone on campus but do abs with us 
Eden Wang: Too far 
Michael Lu: Well are you gonna be consistent if you go alone? 
Eden Wang: Probably more consistent than with you guys No offense Even when you guys are going slow for me it's still really hard for me to keep up I think I gotta just work up 
Michael Lu: That's why you come with us but run your one course 
Eden Wang: Anyways I'm gonna be alone what's the difference 
Michael Lu: I'm asking if you run completely on your own at your own time and will are you going to consistently do it? 
Eden Wang: Idk but it's probably going to work out better I legit want to improve I just don't think it's working with you guys 
Michael Lu: You never even came 
Eden Wang: Once last week Then lab 
Michael Lu: Once What about other morning runs we had Did you run on your own when you didn't come with us? 
Eden Wang: Send them memes to jen directly Yea I'm pretty sure you know the answer to that 
Michael Lu: Okay Then if you won't run with us You should at least be consistent 
Eden Wang: Running distance doesn't come naturally to me I'm trying to make it so 
Michael Lu: It doesn't to anyone 
Eden Wang: Such that I can do it without dying every time 
Michael Lu: John Gould was a sprinter And Brandon Chen was a jumper And Sam Tello was a sprinter And Andy La was a skinny freshman who didn't do sports until 10th grade 
Eden Wang: I get it they all managed to switch Doesn't make it easier for me 
Michael Lu: It doesn't 
Eden Wang: If I'm going to be doing this I want to start to enjoy it 
Michael Lu: It makes you realize it's possible But you have to be consistent 
Eden Wang: When we were running that time I hit 22 min I could've went longer but didn't want to mentally Like I'm not enjoying distance rn I think going slowerMs gonna help 
Michael Lu: Nobody enjoys distance because it's painful, but u gotta be a man and do it everyday 
Eden Wang: Dude I can easily bitch out but I don't want to You guys are really comfortable when you run 
Michael Lu: Not when we started 
Eden Wang: I want to start getting into a comfortable state and move up from there 
Michael Lu: Okay, just make sure you get there 
Eden Wang: We'll see There's value to doing a sport like XC 
Michael Lu: XD running with the big bois i like it 
Eden Wang: I just want to feel like I'm doing something lmao 
Michael Lu: how was your run today?

Michael Lu: u funny 
Eden Wang: Serious question Do you do this to everybody else that doesn't come? I like running with yall But doing so in the morning just makes me tired for the rest of the day 
Michael Lu: You're the one that was hyped to get to XC this year. 
Eden Wang: Hyped isn't the right word I'm willing to work for it but there's a certain limit that I'm not gonna sacrifice beyond 
Michael Lu: so what have you sacrificed in the past 2 weeks? 
Eden Wang: Around two hours a day 10 hours last week Rather be doing more productive things You're legit only judging me over this I'll be back in September 
Michael Lu: you made a goal about this back in June, and you're improving So don't give it up if you wanna get good.

Eden Wang: I've been outlining tons of stuff Bio For example 
Michael Lu: yeah but when somebody asks me what i did over the summer and i say i studied math or comp sci they be like dafuq dat mean whereas some guy working at NASA or lakeville

Eden Wang: A plan was created. The plan for Sun, Sep 17 at 7 AM was deleted. Eh idk I'll lyk later 
Michael Lu: So, u coming? 
Eden Wang: Idk Yo Neville is so annoying Hello Mr. Neville,

You stated in the first week of school that if we presented our case about a particular question, you would review it and judge for yourself whether or not the question was fair or not. On homework #3, I found two main flaws in the questions which I hope to have corrected:

Question #20: Commerce in early colonial America relied in large part on:
A)	barter. Incorrect per MH Connect.
B)	credit. Correct per MH Connect.
C)	gold.
D)	silver.
E)	paper currency.

The textbook (The Unfinished Nation, 8th Edition, Alan Brinkley) states on page 68:

ââ¦ American merchants faced such bewildering obstacles, and lacked so many of the basic institutions of trade, that they managed to stay afloat only with great difficulty and through considerable ingenuity. The colonies had almost no gold or silver, and their paper currency was not acceptable as payment for goods from abroad. For many years, colonial merchants had to rely on barter or on money substitutes such as beaver skins.â

Gold and silver, choices C and D respectively, are obviously incorrect, explicitly stated in the textbook to not be present in the colonies. Choice E is ruled out as well, as paper currency was ânot acceptable as payment for goods from abroad (Page 68).â

Therefore, the only two reasonable choices are choices A and B, barter and credit. Although credit may very well be a key facet of early colonial trade, the Brinkley book makes no mention or reference to it. The only method of trade mentioned as reasonable is barter, as âcolonial merchants had to rely on barter or on money substitutes such as beaver skins (Page 68).â

Question #28: The most common form of resistance of enslaved Africans to their condition was:

A) destruction of crops.
B) poisoning food.
C) arson.
D) running away. Correct per MH Connect.
E) subtle defiance or evasion of their masters. Incorrect per MH Connect.

The textbook (The Unfinished Nation, 8th Edition, Alan Brinkley) states on page 72:

âThe (Stono Rebellion) uprising was quickly crushed, but most participants were executed. A more frequent form of resistance was simply running away, but that provided no real solution either. For most, there was nowhere to go. Resistance more often took the form of subtle, and often undetected, defiance or evasion of their mastersâ wishes."
	
The first three choices are obviously incorrect. The textbook does not mention any of the three choices. In fact, only running away and subtle defiance are even mentioned as methods of resistance in the Brinkley book, from which the questions are derived from.

That leaves choices D and E. The language used in this textbook suggests that though running away was frequent, it did not provide a real solution to their bondage. Therefore, the most frequent form of resistance, for those who had nowhere to go, would be to subtly defy their masters. This deduction does not match the answer presented by the question, which suggests running away to be the primary form of resistance. 

Since these homework assignments are based solely on the text, the questions should directly reference the text and answers should be aligned with the material presented. In this particular case, the McGraw Hill question does not correlate well with the text, whose content suggests a story radically different from that which is implied in the question.

I do not intend to be hostile in writing these long emails. I merely hope to correct a mistake that many of my peers may have encountered as well, and in citing the passages and the text I hope to present a compelling case for my viewpoint. I find it upsetting that while most questions on MH Connect directly reference the text, there are a few discrepancies that lead to even the most careful students to fail.

Thanks for your time, 
Ethan ive had to write like 3 emails to him already. 
Michael Lu: Legit flaming over here 
Eden Wang: That man better give me the points back 
Michael Lu: R u coming tmrw? 
Eden Wang: I'm busy from 10 AM onwards and I gotta stay alert the entire day So I'm gonna say no Tell coach I did tho pls

Conversation:
Eden Wang: Dude you have to watch your mouth Some of the stuff u say legit bothers me 
Michael Lu: Bruv sry but you canât go mooking that Wells is easier than Sckalor when itâs a social taboo 
Eden Wang: I wasnât mocking him jesus And not only that You didnât have to drop the gpa 
Michael Lu: I wasnt addressing specifically your case 
Eden Wang: Your remarks are usually heavier 
Michael Lu: I meant âfocus on your APâ Sry I realized that came out wrong Iâll chill, But u gotta be careful with what you call easy and hard when youâre around less fortunate ppl 
Eden Wang: Dude I wasnât even calling him out seriously You donât have to white knight and make me seem like an ass 
Michael Lu: Bruv donât make ass comments tho I donât mind but other ppl do 
Eden Wang: Even if I concede this thereâs many other cases that youâve said things that didnât need to be said. 
Michael Lu: Ik But I get triggered And Iâm not saying Iâm right 
Eden Wang: You were triggered? My apologies. 
Michael Lu: I just strongly disagreed with how you thot physics curriculum gets easier Side comments are usually humorous, Not trying to attack u, sometimes Iâm insensitive 
Eden Wang: That was meant in good humor. I wasnât legitimately debating you on it 
Michael Lu: But you gotta be more considerate about the common folk 
Eden Wang: Keep the side comments funny. Just think more about their potential connotations before it 
Michael Lu: Some of the stuff both of us say gonna bite us bud 
Eden Wang: What do you mean by that. 
Michael Lu: When we discuss our academics It probably irks our friends Or occasionally 
Eden Wang: Proceed 
Michael Lu: Remember I told you GN kids have a bias against smart ppl Iâve gotten into trouble in the past about this. Maybe Iâm just paranoid, but thatâs just my 2â¬ 
Eden Wang: Only you would take such care to analyze such nuances. Perhaps this bias isnât as systematic and more selective? I digress. For the sake of our mutual friends let us drop this argument. Consider me bested, if you would. However, kindly watch your words lest our tenuous bond degenerate further.

Eden Wang: I donât normally get pissed Is this my issue or his? I canât even tell holy shit

Eden Wang: Honestly I would have tougher skin but he keeps shoving it on me more than other people Yeah weâve never flailed around showing off our papers Heâs being a degenerate shit thatâs legitimately losing my respect 
Michael Lu: Ur right you talk about grades secretly 
Eden Wang: Alright not that extent

Eden Wang: Euphoria isnât mean to last three fucking months Iâve been subject to this for that long Youâve only felt the drafts The entire fucking hurricane is over me right now 
Michael Lu: Euphoria lasts as long as it is nourished Iâm asking Gloria about this 
Eden Wang: Stop with the euphoria talk I get that but his behavior is downright atrocious 
Michael Lu: His atrocious behavior stems from euphoria bruv 
Eden Wang: I donât care itâs his actual behavior not the cause 
Michael Lu: Ik 
Eden Wang: He can be high as shit but doesnât need to flex half as much as he does Im just venting a bit. My feelings arenât as extreme as it seems but the key theme Iâm getting at is still the same 
Michael Lu: Yeah I feel u Lol Gloria says she donât mind But others are annoyed Bro if he doesnât learn the nuances now, heâll learn them eventually Holy sht no chill XD

Conversation:
Eden Wang: Hey are you free for a sec Can you read over a part of hastings social justice thing and let me know what comes to your mind "Mr. Halligan didnât think much of it when his son didnât come down for breakfast. A few extra minutes of sleep couldnât hurt, and for Ryan, who had always been short and frail compared to his middle school peers, this could finally be a sign of his growth spurt. After grabbing his keys and kissing his wife on the cheek, Mr. Halligan had nearly forgotten about his sonâs absence until a blood curling screech shook the Halligan household, followed by the thud of a slammed door. He dropped his bag and dashed up the stairs, prepared to defend his children from possible intruders, but when only silence greeted him at the top, his worry intensified. No way it could be true, he reassured himself, brushing his fears away. Yet when he went to check on his daughter, one look at her terrified face confirmed his worst suspicions. A small slit of light shined across the hall from the crack under the bathroom door. Mr. Halligan took a deep breath, bracing for the worst, and opened the door. He met his son face to face." does the last line make sense? 
Michael Lu: yeah 
Eden Wang: Ok Hanging right 
Michael Lu: oh i thought it was some other form of suicide 
Eden Wang: Ok gotta change that then 
Michael Lu: i mean, maybe i would need more context 
Eden Wang: It probably makes more sense to me than it will to hastings so Iâll probably add some stuff later on Thanks 
Michael Lu: hey do you get the wacky NCTE theme 
Eden Wang: Changing the narrative? 
Michael Lu: yeah 
Eden Wang: More or less, changing how something is perceived Why? 
Michael Lu: like they interchange narrative and story, right? 
Eden Wang: Kind of Narrative is broader Why are you asking? 
Michael Lu: so like you're saying changing narrative means changing how something is perceived, right? 
Eden Wang: Yeah 
Michael Lu: And according to the theme description, narrative = theme narrative = story * but when you change your story aren't you making some really tectonic life change? yes? 
Eden Wang: Hmmmm I guess for us it would be since Hastings pretty explicitly said it should be personal 
Michael Lu: you get my point right? 
Eden Wang: Yeah 
Michael Lu: like the theme description doesn't distinguish the two even though they may imply different things 
Eden Wang: I think they left it vague intentionally Last yearâs theme was pretty vague too 
Michael Lu: lol that's what Nick said yeah, but there wasn't this much of a technicality error right? 
Eden Wang: Lol talked to nice a lot about this 
Michael Lu: last year at least 
Eden Wang: I think they just want anything thatâs arguably âchanging the narrativeâ 
Michael Lu: I hope smh English foqers making life interpretive 
Eden Wang: Lol How personal was your ncte piece 
Michael Lu: kinda personal personal narrative personal ;) 
Eden Wang: Annie gave me a pretty good roasting when I asked her for help LOL 
Michael Lu: lol probably because I tired her out with my questions already 
Eden Wang: Yeah lmfao she told me 
Michael Lu: it's hard being famous/talented XD 
Eden Wang: Oh yes it is indeed Thirsty sophomores are gonna be bothering whoever wins in our year LOL 
Michael Lu: NCTE = Naturally Confusing Themes from Economically-unstable-adults-trying-to-survive-with-their-life-mistake-of-trying-to-become-the-next-charles-dickens this is an old submission that is exemplary 
Eden Wang: What was the theme?? Lmao youâre right about the acronym 
Michael Lu: Did u read her thang? 
Eden Wang: Yeah 
Michael Lu: Whatâs ur guess Or guesses 
Eden Wang: Taking a stand?? 
Michael Lu: Lmao thatâs NHD 
Eden Wang: Fighting for a cause?? Lol yeah 
Michael Lu: Alright check check: Obligation and Passion 
Eden Wang: Ohhhhhhhh that makes sense Yeah the first and last parts 
Michael Lu: Yeah But you didnât guess it at first which is a bit comforting Since the writing doesnât have to obviously/explicitly connect to the theme Unlike NHD 
Eden Wang: I didnât know the list of themes though But if I saw obligation and passion Iâd guess that 
Michael Lu: Yeah yeah Bro I looked her up 
Eden Wang: What about her?? 
Michael Lu: Sheâs so stacked itâs crazy Graduated in 2017 
Eden Wang: Whereâd she go? 
Michael Lu: Idk Probably some lit (literature) school Iâd guess Probably a good one too 
Eden Wang: Yeah... 
Michael Lu: I usually say this about guys But looking at her resumÃ© Sheâs ððð Dope 
Eden Wang: Iâd date just by resume alone 
Michael Lu: Lmao 


Conversation:
Eden Wang: How do you feel about William Yan? Do you think heâs changed or is he still the same person he was. Iâm getting slightly fed up with some of the stuff heâs done and how heâs talked to me. Iâm not sure if my perception of him is unique to me and is my fault or if it has some truth to it. 
Michael Lu: Umm hard to answer given how I seldom talk to him, and how he seldom responds to me. 
Eden Wang: Idk man talking with him feels stressful recently. 
Michael Lu: After he kinda messed up with Jen, I think he gained a little perspective on decency vs indecency, but apart from that Iâm not sure. Well yeah, itâs just stressful talking to him because of his character. 
Eden Wang: Am I a dick if I block him for a bit? I need some time to focus and heâs just stressing me out. 
Michael Lu: Well if you block him he might get mad/suspicious. Does he like message you When u donât want him to? 
Eden Wang: He was kinda rude so I sent him a pretty long paragraph and told him I need some time to myself. In messages 
Michael Lu: Dam when was this 
Eden Wang: Today 
Michael Lu: Yeah, I can see him being rude and all, he isnât particularly sensitive in even casual conversations. But consider that he might not intend to be rude; he hangs out with QB kids, who often explore social taboos and have little regard/conscience of others feelings 
Eden Wang: I tried to help him out when he messed up all that Jen stuff but honestly now I feel harassed and just want him to get his shit together. Iâve been with him for a while and he hasnât always been so rude to me so hopefully he gets better and things donât have to be too awkward. Thanks for your opinion. Hopefully I didnât act too much out of anger and I was at least somewhat justified. 
Michael Lu: Has he responded yet? 
Eden Wang: Blocked, Iâll unblock him in a few days. 
Michael Lu: Ok 
Eden Wang: Omg I just saw the Ugandan knuckles Why is this a thing LMAO

Michael Lu: Alright. 
Eden Wang: You can text me rn not doing anything 
Michael Lu: Okay Itâs about Jen Luo 
Eden Wang: Yeah I kinda expected that 
Michael Lu: You could probably guess that What were you suspecting? 
Eden Wang: You were gonna talk about her 
Michael Lu: What were u suspecting specifically 
Eden Wang: You were gonna say how itâs not going smoothly and I was gonna say things arenât as bad as they might seem rn 
Michael Lu: Okay Well I have my reasons for my sentiments. 
Eden Wang: Yeah not saying theyâre ungrounded 
Michael Lu: But by all means, I trust you to make objections So if you have to say something during this conversation by all means say it 
Eden Wang: Yeah you can drop the formalities a bit if youâd like Casual is better cause Iâm sleep deprived 
Michael Lu: Iâm not here to seek petty condolences or idealistic clichÃ©s Iâd like ur advice an knowledge 
Eden Wang: Alright thatâs cool with me 
Michael Lu: U realize right That we are very similar In mindset And we share some experiences So thatâs why Iâm asking u And not lie B Cho 
Eden Wang: Alright I wouldnât even as that boy about bio Off topic sorry 
Michael Lu: So I might have to ask u About ur past Most likely Jen Wang if u donât mind I hear things are going well now 
Eden Wang: Depends No âthingsâ 
Michael Lu: R u okay with that? 
Eden Wang: Uh just ask lol Iâm open to whatever you need 
Michael Lu: Aight so here goes Jen and I started dating November And stuff went well until January Even if we never went on many actual outings It was at least a decent promissing investment 
Eden Wang: Uh objection Q Donât think of it as an investment 
Michael Lu: What would u think of it as 
Eden Wang: I dunno man I just wanna know jen after high school We fam 
Michael Lu: Aight aight fair point ð 
Eden Wang: Yea 
Michael Lu: But you have to realize something: I donât want to fucking become a Brian Cho + Joyce A Lee pseudo-pair As much as I like Jen Lunch Lol Jen Luo* 
Eden Wang: I mean whatâs a pseudo pair Lol I agree 
Michael Lu: Like u like each other low key But u never allocate proper time to develop the relationship And eventually the relationship just becomes a burden or a nuisance Like at this point, Brian gives < 2 **** And he moves on to another girl You see what I mean? 
Eden Wang: Well like do you think youâre headed on that path 
Michael Lu: I fear that we are 
Eden Wang: Why 
Michael Lu: We havenât done anything in January 
Eden Wang: Lol you have to be really degenerate to go there 
Michael Lu: When I ask, either sheâs sick, busy, or last time she didnât even explain 
Eden Wang: Stop thinking about it as things man Lol you know that jen and I were good since december But I didnât say anything about dating cause I just liked her as a person and didnât want to sabotage that If thatâs really what you want then just keep doing what youâre doing without fussing over the âthingsâ Lol sorry I might not fully make sense but Iâm just saying what I think Jen thinks youâre quiet recently because youâre really busy with robotics 
Michael Lu: Yeah I see your point but 
Eden Wang: She still mentions you and you two talk a lot still so itâs not as bad as youâre making it sound 
Michael Lu: I feel like the relationship is going a bit slack tho 
Eden Wang: Donât try too hard 
Michael Lu: Whatâs ur advice? 
Eden Wang: Talk more and worry less about the actual dates and stuff You mentioned to me when you first began dating that you were gonna take it slow lol 
Michael Lu: And I did Hella slow 
Eden Wang: Some parts felt a bit rushed 
Michael Lu: Which parts 
Eden Wang: I canât scrape up specifics right now but donât take it too personally Why donât you text jen rn Ask her how her day was Sheâs sitting next to me 
Michael Lu: Now thatâs another thing I do text her and wish her good luck on the AMC, HMMT, NMT But Nowadays I donât get the same return 
Eden Wang: What do you mean by same return 
Michael Lu: I ask her how she feels when she is sick Like I donât rlly feel like she had the same enthusiasm as before, now maybe Iâm overanalyzing but little things can hurt 
Eden Wang: I mean Iâll say two thoughts 1 being that after a while relationships do dim a bit and arenât as enthusiastic as the beginning 2 being that maybe youâre trying too hard and itâs not as genuine anymore 
Michael Lu: Itâs hard to prod a man to action when he is dying inside. I agree with you 
Eden Wang: Hey Iâm not fully woke rn donât hit me with fancy sayings 
Michael Lu: Lol Aight my b But I have tried to try harder You know, pat her head, talk to her, walk with her after class But sometimes itâs hard to do When itâs not returned... 
Eden Wang: Itâs so forced ngl Thatâs the feel Iâm getting 
Michael Lu: Yes it is Because itâs not genuine or reciprocal anymore 
Eden Wang: Look her feeling for you might not be the same as before but itâs not like you guys are completely done I think itâs a faulty mindset tbh Like you need to stop thinking of it so practically lol No offense 
Michael Lu: Yeah the practical mindset has an ugly root In my past 
Eden Wang: Iâll tell you briefly about how I got back together So I apologized to her in December and we started talking again Really normal and casual We naturally spent time together and realized that we like each other for who we are and organically got back And now weâre like more in love than before haha 
Michael Lu: I see 
Eden Wang: Moral of he story Just be natural 
Michael Lu: So in that case 
Eden Wang: Itâs not like you changed too significantly since November 
Michael Lu: Would I do anything? 
Eden Wang: Youâd loosen up thats what you should do 
Michael Lu: I should just not force anything? 
Eden Wang: Be more natural Yeah 
Michael Lu: Not âtryâ (too hard) 
Eden Wang: Yes yes 
Michael Lu: What if itâs misinterpreted? As lethargy 
Eden Wang: Thereâs two things that might happen One is that you loosen up and realize that you were trying too hard and forcing something that wasnât working The other (and sadder) thing is that you realize the entire relationship just wasnât meant to be and that the person you actually are wouldnât work well with her. I ship you two donât get me wrong But if it isnât natural itâs not gonna work long. 
Michael Lu: Lemme ask you, why and how did you break up with Jen Wang? 
Eden Wang: I tried too hard to force something that I felt âdidnât have enough thingsâ and became someone I really wasnât and that we both knew wasnât right. Not even lying dude the parallels are there 
Michael Lu: Dam Dammmmmm Profound 
Eden Wang: I got back with her because I truly think sheâs a great person that I would like to know after college and beyond We already agreed that weâd break up on graduation And that if when we broke up weâd remain friends Maybe our breakup really made things real? Who knows man Whatever it is we agreed to enjoy what we have right now and make the most memories out of it. Iâm conscious of how things are right now and Iâll hopefully be able to avoid the mishaps that ended us the first time around. Genuine is better. You canât live a lie That was deep. You just got a taste of how Iâd be when Iâm drunk. 
Michael Lu: Schfax Dam 
Eden Wang: And trust me I am very far from sober right now 
Michael Lu: Holy shit thatâs a year book quote/maxim 
Eden Wang: Three hours of sleep and five hours of math kills the soul Think over what I said Iâm gonna sleep for a while 
Michael Lu: Dam 
Eden Wang: Itâs gonna be a long rest and Jenâs sleeping rn 
Michael Lu: Not done yet but okay? 
Eden Wang: Yeah later Promise 
Michael Lu: I owe you 
Eden Wang: Actually finish rn 
Michael Lu: Okay I think given your greater experience Iâll take ur advice 
Eden Wang: Look honestly High school relationships are fake So go for something greater 
Michael Lu: Now we need closure on how specifically I am to do this Lol wdym 
Eden Wang: Jen and I have the same last name so itâs easy Weâre basically family :) 
Michael Lu: XD Aight aight 
Eden Wang: Oh I got a good one Drunk me would like to object When you date someone You see them more intimately Treat them the way you would a child Like Give the benefit of the doubt If she does something that you feel hurt by Think maybe sheâs actually tired 
Michael Lu: I guess 
Eden Wang: Cause when you feel anger or anything It leaches in to your other conversations 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Eden Wang: Humans are good with emotions She could probably tell youâre quieter and reserved when you text her even if she doesnât directly know it Alright I digress What did you need Ill tell you what Iâd like from you after Not too difficult 
Michael Lu: What was/would be forced 
Eden Wang: Just enjoy her presence Talk with her when you need but otherwise just enjoy your time with her Stop worrying about dates and stuff They come naturally when you two like each other enough 
Michael Lu: Yah so what specifically was/would be forced 
Eden Wang: Texting her every day Withclike generic questions Howâs your day Whatâs up Make your texts more meaningful And silence shouldnât be undervalued Honestly itâs a mentality shift you need 
Michael Lu: What about birthday posts? 
Eden Wang: Why her birthday isnât coming up soon 
Michael Lu: Okay nvm then 
Eden Wang: Youâll either be close or not dating next time that comes around Sorry to be blunt Oh you know what was a red flag for me That time on a Friday when you kept texting me about jen And why she wouldnât go to Starbucks 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Eden Wang: Yiu weâre totally over analyzing that 
Michael Lu: Regret 
Eden Wang: I hope you didnât say anything to her about it 
Michael Lu: No I just asked then let her go 
Eden Wang: Jen Luoâs a nice person So think about whatâs really important to you If you do break up, make sure it isnât dramatic Stay friends. I donât know how you two got together in the first place so I canât judge, but if you really like her you wouldnât give up your friendship. Oh yeah really easy tip Be nice Do thoughtful things you think she would appreciate If you canât think of anything then somethingâs really wrong. Has this satiated your desire for a path? 
Michael Lu: Final few questions 
Eden Wang: And then me 
Michael Lu: Should I do anything for Valentineâs Day? 
Eden Wang: Be extra nice 
Michael Lu: Like at most a gift? 
Eden Wang: Offer to hold her things or something Buy some chocolate Be niceeee Idk why I didnât say that earlier 
Michael Lu: Do I text her anymore today or tmrw? Or Valentineâs Day? 
Eden Wang: Idk text her whenever you feel you have something interesting to say Yo I didnât even think about Valentineâs Day and jen Wang yet Youâre still thinking too much into the relationship 
Michael Lu: I mean Valentineâs Day is kinda like u know 
Eden Wang: Not really 
Michael Lu: Lest there be one day? 
Eden Wang: You donât have to conform so hard Trust me 
Michael Lu: Should I even buy a modest box of candy? 
Eden Wang: Yeah sure Thatâs smart 
Michael Lu: Would you? 
Eden Wang: Yeah sure Chocolate is nice 
Michael Lu: Aight I guess I should laissez fairs more 
Eden Wang: Just donât make it a huge deal 
Michael Lu: Yup 
Eden Wang: Yeah 
Michael Lu: I agree 
Eden Wang: Any other questions Iâm gonna sleep soon so leave some time for me 
Michael Lu: Yep I owe u Big time Godspeed Ethan 
Eden Wang: Alright my turn? 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Eden Wang: First things first I heard that the existing Scioly a team chat is riddled with ridicule from my old friend smaedrian How true is that 
Michael Lu: Lol can u like not play on words 
Eden Wang: Adrian likes to talk shit bout me Tell me who on a team has beef with me Or you think has the slightest inclination against me 
Michael Lu: Adrian maybe But itâs not like he hates you 
Eden Wang: Adrian definitely What has he said 
Michael Lu: And constantly talks smack 
Eden Wang: Iâm calm about it but Iâd like to know the source of his disdain 
Michael Lu: The most prominent/recent was simply Yuhan and Adrian talking about ur 3 Olympiad thing 
Eden Wang: Send me some transcripts if you can Some background 
Michael Lu: It was like 5 lines 
Eden Wang: I used to think that I was truly just a duck that pissed off everyone I talked to because of my arrogance 
Michael Lu: I donât think that they hate you 
Eden Wang: But when I talk to people like Kelley and Annie I realized that itâs probably not me 
Michael Lu: Wdym 
Eden Wang: Iâve never had any issues with Kelley or Annie Always very nice and wholesome chats 
Michael Lu: Yeah Idk I think if anything Ppl who talk about you are just finding your academic endeavors to be a novelty 
Eden Wang: Even jen admitted that you guys need a new A team chat simply because of the amount of slander in there 
Michael Lu: And thus arenât always good at expressing themselves 
Eden Wang: Iâd just like some justification And also if the rest of the A team just letâs it slide 
Michael Lu: I scrolled up A lot There was slander on Brian Cho From me And by âslanderâ I mean Kelley and I agree donât send him to Princeton 
Eden Wang: Yeah I know about hay 
Michael Lu: Umm I canât really find that much about you Besides the 3 Olympiad thing Honestly, I doubt Yuhan has anything against you And Adrian doesnât really have anything against you either 1. That GNS confession for wells v Sckalor was just bandwagon He didnt like the idea, but itâs not that he didnât like you 2. That Scioly sarcastic event trading post Was issued and written by Dr T And Jen Wang wouldâve posted it but Adrian wanted to make it a meme It wasnât about you He was just trying to be funny, not reprimanding 
Eden Wang: Whatever man I still think itâs sus 
Michael Lu: Give him the benefit of the doubt 
Eden Wang: No I really wouldnât like to 
Michael Lu: And if he doesnât like you, who cares, heâs gonna graduate very soon Thatâs what you told me a few months ago And thatâs what you told me today 
Eden Wang: Honestly I donât care But Iâm not gonna change my opinion of him 
Michael Lu: I mean, what evidence do you have 
Eden Wang: Youâre right but let me have this one splotch of emotion Iâll talk to you some other time again. This topic isnât over. 
Michael Lu: Alrighty Get some sleep I doubt ur sober rn 
Eden Wang: Youâre right Some other time. 
Michael Lu: Humans are terrible with emotions. Donât let them control you. 
Eden Wang: Lol that honestly doesnât matter to me I would just like to know what exactly they say that makes a new chat justifiable More or less for amusement purposes And the more yâall a kids hide it the more interesting it becomes for me 
Michael Lu: Ok 
Eden Wang: Omg does concession #2112 sound too much like me I swear I didnât write it 
Michael Lu: No 
Eden Wang: Can you hmu with a ride for Thursday Can you get me a ride tomorrow For scioly

Conversation:
Michael Lu: And so I begin my long, arduous journey through the dark, cold night, enduring the punishments with which the Lord spites me. A small, feeble boy treks through the unyielding Earth with a destroyed leg and a disillusioned mind â he has lost his faith in humanity and more importantly himself. ð deadass 
Eden Wang: Iâd like to criticize the writing but I like the overall theme so coolio

Conversation:
Michael Lu: XD 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: My man Very insightful 
Eden Wang: Hahaha Man of little words 


Conversation:
Eden Wang: Hey are you busy 
Michael Lu: Whatâs up 
Eden Wang: Alright lemme rant a bit So thereâs Hannah Who I talked to over the weekend right I told her that I wasnât taking her spot and that it wasnât fair for her to try and make me drop All this is about Chem Olympiad 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Eden Wang: So I thought she took that well But then I heard that she started bitching with William about me And today 
Michael Lu: When today? 
Eden Wang: No this was last week basically Saturday/Sunday in the cancer Chem chat And Iâm like 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Eden Wang: Those Chem kids are fucking degenerates Whatever 
Michael Lu: Not all But I see What u mean 
Eden Wang: So this week I start hearing some whispers And today In gym 6th period Hannah and Will openly start complaining That Iâm stealing Hannahâs spot And that Iâm a fucking dick 
Michael Lu: Geez u srs 
Eden Wang: And Iâm arrogant af Even Amanda Miao and Sharon heard 
Michael Lu: Is this all Hannah? 
Eden Wang: Thatâs how big this shit is getting And WILLIAM 
Michael Lu: Hmm 
Eden Wang: Even the Scioly people know by this point Alright now let me explain my part When I first started hearing that Hannah was complaining I didnât say anything cause I kinda expected it right I let her be mad for a bit because itâs normal for her to be irrationally angry about that for a bit But this shit isnât stopping And Iâm actually beginning to get REALLY pissed William Yan He doesnât talk shit to my face 
Michael Lu: I see Dam Iâm surprised about will 
Eden Wang: But if he doesnât have a spine to say something when Hannahâs openly and obviously being a dick I need to talk with him No William lowkey hates me I dropped deca off him 
Michael Lu: Does he? 
Eden Wang: Scioly stuff too But whatever I donât like him the best either 
Michael Lu: I mean what if he was just trying to not oppose Hannah? 
Eden Wang: But when other people shit talk him And oh boy they do I donât contribute But this doesnât work both ways When Hannah and William have shit on me They arenât cautious with their words at all So now Iâm pissed at Hannah and William I think I will write With no audience at first But I will find one 
Michael Lu: Wdym 
Eden Wang: Be it Hersh or the Dean 
Michael Lu: Woah woah woah Hold on a sec Do you want my honest opinion? 
Eden Wang: What 
Michael Lu: I agree that Hannah and Will shouldnât be this upset/vicious 
Eden Wang: Donât tell me you ducking support their claim Iâm not dropping Chem oly Especially after all this shit 
Michael Lu: But you should try to talk to Will first 
Eden Wang: In fact I want to steal that shit from them so ducking much now 
Michael Lu: No I think if youâre good you deserve it bro Hersh/dean canât do anything really And if they do Like Hannah and Will Might just get more cancerous 
Eden Wang: No I donât care I just want to expose their shit 
Michael Lu: At least talk to Will first 
Eden Wang: Bitch hasnât responded He was fucking active when I sent it 
Michael Lu: This isnât worth your time going all the way to hersh/dean and then getting called from class and then supplying witnesses and shit 
Eden Wang: No Iâm just sending a letter And confessions perhaps If I get salty enough 
Michael Lu: Youâre mature enough to handle this without teachers Wield the hammer yourself bud Itâll give u more satisfaction 
Eden Wang: Dude itâs not about maturity 
Michael Lu: Okay well thatâs just my opinion Is he responding with anymore info? 
Eden Wang: Heâs being a bitch Thatâs what He says why arenât I asking Jen 
Michael Lu: Wow Welp Now what 
Eden Wang: Talking with him I mentioned dean and got him talking again 
Michael Lu: Is he conceding?

Michael Lu: U pull out ur laptop in class But ok then

Michael Lu: Lol u fuq 
Eden Wang: Yo can I talk to you later 
Michael Lu: What time? 
Eden Wang: Later Iâm busy rn but Iâll lyk I heard that Jen invited you to the board already to decide stuff for next year Was this T? Or did jen just invite you on a whim 
Michael Lu: The original A team went to go decide next yearâs team. 
Eden Wang: I feel bad for Brian Like jen mentioned it today 
Michael Lu: Which 
Eden Wang: Yâall need to take it easier Brian Cho He has a good average 
Michael Lu: Which Jen 
Eden Wang: Which one would let it slip 
Michael Lu: He has a good average But he does events we already have covered 
Eden Wang: Did you hear about what happened Take it easy on him 
Michael Lu: What 
Eden Wang: Make it more about average Kat wrote a huge ass essay and dropped it on his ass 
Michael Lu: Yeah I saw that Not related to Scioly But yes I felt bad 
Eden Wang: Thatâs kinda fucked up 
Michael Lu: She led him on Then dropped him off 
Eden Wang: He hasnât made shitty bio jokes And is just depressed Whatever 
Michael Lu: He made it up with her though Theyâre still social 
Eden Wang: Whoâs on the team next year Please tell me it ainât cancer 
Michael Lu: Itâs pretty similar to this yearâs team Jen will release the team later 
Eden Wang: Who are the seniors Is Hannah on it 
Michael Lu: Youâd have to ask Jen 
Eden Wang: Seriously 
Michael Lu: Hold on 
Eden Wang: She fucking teased us at Sb about it I swear 
Michael Lu: Who Hannah or Jen? 
Eden Wang: Jen ofc Kept bringing up scioly How did you pick the team I heard you picked up Anthony Wtf If Hannahâs not on and he is thatâs broke af 
Michael Lu: Okay look I need to study cram APUSH rn But Iâll get back to you And Iâll be frank 
Eden Wang: Iâm gonna be honest and leave you with this If next year is half as corrupt as this year and itâs just you and jen making all the decisions Iâm outta there Do you want my apush outline Itâs finally done 
Michael Lu: Cool Okay You should elaborate on what you mean by âcorruptâ. You drop it left and right â please explain. Brian Cho had a good study average, but he had two dead events (rocks, game on), and we have herp and bio events covered by u and Jen Donât forget the dam 7 senior limit Of which 5 slots are filled up, plus Kat, so we only have room for one senior As for Anthony, we need a math person for fermi and the code buster event coming up, and weâd rather fill that spot up with a young person rather than a one time shot senior who will graduate. Finally, A Team was decided by Jen, me, Annie Zhang, Dr. T, and Spinelli Thereâs still room on the team so if you want to do something Talk to T or Spinelli 
Eden Wang: Weâll see how things play out.

Michael Lu: how do you find the slope of a parabola? pls halp 
Emma Lu: derivative 
Michael Lu: j ja okay elaborate pls halp 
Emma Lu: you can only find the slope at aceratain point bc the slopes are all different at different point so like if your parabola function is x^2 
Michael Lu: aceratain? 
Emma Lu: *a certain 
Michael Lu: okay do you take the avg of derivatives? 
Emma Lu: ..no??? 
Michael Lu: wat do then pls halp 
Emma Lu: do you know how to find the derivative of a parabola 
Michael Lu: power rule? 
Emma Lu: sure anyway when you get the derivative 
Michael Lu: 2c 2x* for x^2 
Emma Lu: you plug in the x an y coordinates and that will give you the slope at that coordinate 
Michael Lu: yeah but that's for just one point 
Emma Lu: yeah 
Michael Lu: wat about the other coorsd and the parabola as a whole? 
Emma Lu: ??? why do you have to find the slope of the whole parabola 
Michael Lu: idk 
Emma Lu: you use the same formula of the derivative but plug in different values 
Michael Lu: is there a way to represent the parabola as a whole? 
Emma Lu: different coordinates Idk ask someone smarter 
Michael Lu: :|

Michael Lu: why not just d 
Emma Lu: sure but d/dx is just more clear

Emma Lu: Because it is Like 1+1 = 2 That's about it 
Michael Lu: how does HONGS work? 
Emma Lu: What is HONGS 
Michael Lu: HGONS* HOGNS* how do they decide who to interview? who runs it?

Michael Lu: Ok U interviewed a lot of authors Did they already write in books the stuff they told you? 
Emma Lu: yea 
Michael Lu: So it was redundant to interview, but it gave bonus nevertheless? 
Emma Lu: well no youre suppoed to ask about how they got into their field of research, create an emotional appeal you also hsould read the books and see what they didnt asnwer or ask people who are tangentially related 
Michael Lu: Ik what I should be doing but what did u guys do 
Emma Lu: we didn't do a good job bc we didnt read their books but we just asked things like how did they find out abuot it just like maknig htem talk a long time and then asking a lot of follow pus

Michael Lu: Ye 


Conversation:
Emma Lu: 1) dont underline conflict n compromise in your thesis its annoying
2) think about readability: the really long (length wise) blocks of text are hard to read, as is white on black text
3) long quotes are boring. think about how you can make them shorter or emphasize key points of information. a good strategy is to use quotes for important information or even inline quotes to take away from your word count. the words YOU are responsible for are analysis of information/tying it back to the theme 4) make your captions smaller or make your main text bigger. everything is the same and design wise it doesn't logically read which information is more importnat 5) format your images better, a lot of them are big/low resoluotion and don't look good 6) interactivity is good 7) a lot of statistics and graphs are meaningless if you don't have some clear explanation of them a lot of images and quotes show up in minimal context which is ok because of your word limit but also think abuot how you are communicating information aso dont randomly put audio snippets without explanation a lot of website depends on how easy it is to navigate. we got points off because we didn't tell the judges where to click (lol) a lot of your pages are sparse in content, so i would maybe group them better and mix/match engaging content with less engaging contnt, ie: instead of having 3 back to back quotes, maybe quotes + image, or video + quotes i dont know how much control weebly let you have on your image palcements but some of them are really bad ie this would be better flushed side to side a lot of your written body text ie : the last sentence you write on this page, could be emphasize a lot of the website is really about presentation you just have the upper hand because online presentation is easeir to handle than physical presentation like the actual trifold i'm sick btw so i can't give you full advice for all your acutal historical content this doesnt' really make sense int he context fo your topic 
Michael Lu: Dam ok So should I take out the voting entire legacy crap? 
Emma Lu: I think so keep it just in case htough 
Michael Lu: Is there any way we can improve the fundamental argument of the project Like the thesis kinda sucks 
Emma Lu: ya lol mmm iâll take another look since i donât rly know abt the theme or this particular topic 
Michael Lu: Good then you will really be able to objectively see how bad it is 
Emma Lu: ya lol why do you care so much 
Michael Lu: Because itâs faking due Friday 
Emma Lu: lol alright 
Michael Lu: I originally had a more polarized/opinionated one But Tria struck it down because it was biased 
Emma Lu: sure 
Michael Lu: Now Iâm stuck Did u look 
Emma Lu: my guy i'm sick and need to do homework too 
Michael Lu: Lol aight 
Emma Lu: i wont be getting to this while ur awake 
Michael Lu: I mean just the thesis For now 
Emma Lu: Ok i mean the whole point of thesis is to have opinion i actually think the reason your thesis sucks right nwo is because its too summary base it's literally stating the facts 
Michael Lu: IKR Iâm changing it 
Emma Lu: ya lol umm what are you changing it too 
Michael Lu: Iâm working on that Probably like Then conflict was over the draft sucking at being fair He compromises tried to make the draft fair And ended protest But not the fundamental questions of the protest 
Emma Lu: what were the fundamental questions of the protest Thats good 
Michael Lu: Can we make military service fair And democratic 
Emma Lu: a thesis can be like "this conflict/attempt to compromise revealed greater rifts in the american conscience or whateveR" sure 
Michael Lu: Fuq 
Emma Lu: military is bad but thats a different question 
Michael Lu: Itâs is good too Thats* 
Emma Lu: and you can use your historical background as "this is the conflict and compromise that happened on the legistlative level or whatever" simply in terms of what happened in the draft/ the evolution of the draft and the specific protests of the 60s but then lead into "there's a larger conflict at stake" which are the question s you are thinking about also you did bring up factors of race/age that could definitely be interesting to work intot his 
Michael Lu: I would but itâs too late to focus on the relationship between draft & society I really shouldâve Also wdym about historical backgrounds 
Emma Lu: makes sense i think theres a section of the project where you have to talk abuot historical context look this is the first round right you can always change your project up a lot if you get to round 2 if you really want to 
Michael Lu: Ok As if 
Emma Lu: like maybe for this one keep what you have but add some more or change some stuff at the end to fit your new thesis and then please change the looks lol it's so bad 
Michael Lu: Why 
Emma Lu: if you make it then cool you can rework it but if you don't you don't have to worry about it it literally doesnt mean anything it's just cus tria likes to win hehe hoho bad looks man...just bad looks 
Michael Lu: Wtf Ok 
Emma Lu: it's like not fun to look at 
Michael Lu: Good 
Emma Lu: Ok cool 
Michael Lu: The topic is a dark time in American history 
Emma Lu: Ur right

Eric Kuang: Do you have Dickson? 
Michael Lu: yes 
Eric Kuang: In that case I have no idea what he wants I had weisswange 
Michael Lu: darn 
Eric Kuang: Because technically you can draw a lot of conclusions from it Ask weiting He had Dickson 
Michael Lu: but is the power series 1 + x + x^2 + x^3... with convergence interval (-1, 1) i asked weiting on the bus he forgot 
Eric Kuang: Idk what Dickson wantsâ¦this is too vague 
Michael Lu: ok 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: å¸å¥ How did you make your Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock AI OP?

Eric Kuang: To store a pattern and what is the next move 
Michael Lu: I see 
Eric Kuang: Then when the opponent plays, the program looks for this pattern 
Michael Lu: Dam 
Eric Kuang: Or you can learn Markov chain and make it actually OP Aka the one made by weisswange 
Michael Lu: OP LEVEL: S T A N F O R D Lol Markova doesnât that require lkke Stat 
Eric Kuang: Nope it's Princeton Yeah But it's weisswange He knows everything

Michael Lu: thx 
Brian Cho: I can do the math section The reading is giving me chances Cancer 
Michael Lu: reading you just have to practice a lot 
Brian Cho: Yeah How about writing? Ok thanks 
Michael Lu: Because if you do enough questions (same applies to writing kinda too), you notice the type of questions and what they're looking for 
Brian Cho: Ok 
Michael Lu: and it puts you into a certain mindset. 
Brian Cho: Got it 
Michael Lu: writing you should learn legit grammar first tho. 
Brian Cho: Ye I do just some of the practice tests I do the questions are retarded "Of these ends" 
Michael Lu: yeah that has to do with the legitimacy of the tests 
Brian Cho: College board tho??? 
Michael Lu: are those collegeboard tests? 
Brian Cho: Ye 
Michael Lu: from where 
Brian Cho: I got a 1510 on one That's it 
Michael Lu: that's already good, and you have time 
Brian Cho: College bird book with 8 practice tests 
Michael Lu: you did all 8? 
Brian Cho: I think the latter half 5,6,7,8 Because why not 
Michael Lu: yeah collegeboard ones should be legit 
Brian Cho: They should be Gotta improve my score more tho 
Michael Lu: if you're getting less than 10 wrong on reading or less than 6 wrong on writing then it's just practicing 
Brian Cho: 7 wrong on writing 5 wrong on reading My writing section sucks 
Michael Lu: what type of writing questions are you getting wrong? 
Brian Cho: Uhh The ones where it asks u pick a phrase or word to transition 
Michael Lu: what else 
Brian Cho: And context of words stuff 
Michael Lu: oh you can't really learn those. 
Brian Cho: Ye I got the others Just those 
Michael Lu: i mean i guess you could study the transitions a bit 
Brian Cho: Yeah the problem is "of these ends" is a transition I don't even know what means 
Michael Lu: yeah some of the questions are just BS you'd have to guess 
Brian Cho: Also some of the move this sentence to right spot questions are retarded because there are two very close answers sometimes 
Michael Lu: yeah those are hard just do 3 - 4 articles a day man, it'll get better. do you use khanacademy? 
Brian Cho: No College bird books 
Michael Lu: use that for practicing writing and reading 
Brian Cho: Ok 
Michael Lu: they partner with CB so the questions have good resemblance. 
Brian Cho: Oh really That's good 
Michael Lu: yah 
Brian Cho: Ok gotta read the jungle Bye 
Michael Lu: khanacademy, crackthesat.net, collegeboard resources are the 3 legit ones bye

Brian Cho: Micheal I'm being flamed 
Michael Lu: Yeah I saw man :/ 
Brian Cho: Holy shit What is their problem It isn't me That shit wasn't me It could've been any other grade but no it has to be brian Fuck me 
Michael Lu: Dude just convince them it wasn't you 
Brian Cho: THEY DONT LISTEN ITS LIKE BENDING A STEEL ROD EXCEPT THE ROD IS SOLID 
Michael Lu: Idk maybe they just want distance? 
Brian Cho: HELLO I ONLY TALK TO GLORIA AND IM FORCED TO TALK WITH BELINDA 
Michael Lu: Forced? 
Brian Cho: Yoyo That's why I want to quit But I can't ditch Justin 
Michael Lu: Did you tell them it wasn't you over text? 
Brian Cho: Yes And they don't believe me 
Michael Lu: That's not as convincing as telling them in person 
Brian Cho: Well I m not walking to their houses and saying it ain't me 
Michael Lu: Okay so do it tmrw or Monday 
Brian Cho: Ur telling me to walk into a pit of fire 
Michael Lu: I'm telling you the only way to get out of the pit of fire is to extinguish it the right way 
Brian Cho: Sigh 
Michael Lu: TBH 
Brian Cho: Rip me 
Michael Lu: Tell them (whomever needs to be told) in a genuine way that it wasn't you, then you probably need to give them some space. Whoever* 
Brian Cho: Okay I'll single them out someway So I don't get 6 people at the same times 
Michael Lu: You don't even need to tell all of them, just tell the few that we're affected 
Brian Cho: They all flamed me So 
Michael Lu: All 6? 
Brian Cho: Like 4 
Michael Lu: But the posts only involved about like 3 ppl Or less idk 
Brian Cho: I DISNT POST THEM And also thy flame me to protect Belinda 
Michael Lu: You're going to have to tell at least one of them personally it wasn't you 
Brian Cho: I'm going to start with gloria 
Michael Lu: Yep But make sure you talk to Belinda because she's the one that explicitly got mad and instigated this fire 
Brian Cho: See the thing is her yelling is bad And she'll start crying and shit 
Michael Lu: Who cares? Get yourself out of the fire pit. 
Brian Cho: I'll try But if she starts crying and shit I'm fucking dipping 
Michael Lu: She won't cry don't underestimate her 
Brian Cho: Because that's when her possy is showing up 
Michael Lu: Tell her at yoyo then 
Brian Cho: I'll wait for that 
Michael Lu: Also btw, it would help if you actually responded to the confessions that impersonate you Ignoring them doesn't help you You gotta comment actively and demonstrate it wasn't you If you want to prevent stuff like this from happening again 
Brian Cho: Oml I'll just do the math Matt I can't make up a random excuse 
Michael Lu: Don't give bad ones though Did you post any of the earlier ones (not the recent ones) 
Brian Cho: Yes 
Michael Lu: Well dammit Brian 
Brian Cho: Supposedly only gloria knew but she can't hold it in so 
Michael Lu: You can't half lie then :( You can't say "I only wrote the first few confessions" can you? 
Brian Cho: I can but they already know that Because gloria 
Michael Lu: Okay here are the options I think you have: Tell them in person that you didn't write the recent ones Or just act like you wrote them and say you're sorry, they might take it better if you give them the honesty that THEY want 
Brian Cho: I'll do the first I'm not admitting to that 
Michael Lu: But keep in mind The established bias 
Brian Cho: Yeah 
Michael Lu: That they think you wrote them all 
Brian Cho: IM TRIGGERED BY THAT I DIDNT WEITE THEM I'll just tel them face to face 
Michael Lu: Okay ð 
Brian Cho: Hopefully this puts out the flame 
Michael Lu: Good luck my friend :)

Daniel Lu: . You're better than me in literally every other sense Sooooo 
Michael Lu: doesn't matter in this case 
Daniel Lu: . 
Michael Lu: hue hue hue gj 
Daniel Lu: . Wow you fell for that line 
Michael Lu: wat 
Daniel Lu: Is acknowledge what I say that you would know is said non genuine 
Michael Lu: wat 
Daniel Lu: You no get reference? 
Michael Lu: ? 
Daniel Lu: Its like if I'm even acknowledged in any field aside from this world AP course 
Michael Lu: that's not a complete sentence 
Daniel Lu: ,,, Fine I'll revise it Its not like I'm acknowledged in any other context aside from World History AP Course. 
Michael Lu: so your point is? 
Daniel Lu: . THis one thing Is just not such big deal Espeiclaly considering Just how many people solely see me as that guy who is a history buff 
Michael Lu: okay 
Daniel Lu: And is confirm In a week everyone will forget this score And i will return to being a nobody So not worth celebrating 
Michael Lu: :| 
Daniel Lu: I like just how apathetic you are Hehehe 
Michael Lu: hue 
Daniel Lu: That basically confirms everything I've said 
Michael Lu: how so? 
Daniel Lu: Hmmmmm Either that Or you just don't give a shit At all 
Michael Lu: if i didn't then i wouldn't be congratulating you 
Daniel Lu: . I'm not talking about that solely Is about how fleeting it is 
Michael Lu: so how did i show apathy towards that concept? 
Daniel Lu: And considering how people only view me as that guy who is history buff and antisocial
Makes it all the more shallow 
Michael Lu: well, if you want people to see beyond that you should put it out there 
Daniel Lu: . 
Michael Lu: and express other talents 
Daniel Lu: Like what Put it out like what 
Michael Lu: whatever talents you have that are better than everybody elses 
Daniel Lu: I'm asking about how does one put it out 
Michael Lu: well, in academic classes it would be by participation, sharing grades, etc everybody knows your passion for soc because you have been very vocal about it for many years 
Daniel Lu: . So vocality 
Michael Lu: yeah 
Daniel Lu: Basically being the voice Also Academic classes alone though... What I'm mostly talking about is outside of that Academically speaking someone can develop their passion if they look at it extensively
And it seems like something people just care so much about 
Michael Lu: so basically you want people to see you beyond your soc studies ability or beyond your academic talent? 
Daniel Lu: Academic talent is honestly shallow Because outside of school it wouldn't do much good 
Michael Lu: okay but you didn't answer my question 
Daniel Lu: . Ok I'll be more clear Basically Ja Annnnnnd you are one who basically is the well rounded individual that people do look up to 
Michael Lu: so... wat do you want??? to have people see you as well-rounded? 
Daniel Lu: . Its not exactly a specific question that I set out for it to be answered But sure Given that it led up to it 
Michael Lu: what is your original intention??????? 
Daniel Lu: You're rather concerned about what I wanted originally before the current intention Though I do have to admit It started off as simple test sharing 
Michael Lu: yes it did 
Daniel Lu: And then I felt rather badly and fleeting Due to just how shallow such "talent" is for a simple class 
Michael Lu: so it's just a comment? 
Daniel Lu: . Is there something wrong 
Michael Lu: nope just need clarification 
Daniel Lu: With me just saying what I somewhat think 
Michael Lu: so if it's just a comment 
Daniel Lu: And what you see beyond that asian face every day 
Michael Lu: then how was i apathetic? 
Daniel Lu: Well the thing is At the moment I basically launched into rant mode albeit unconsciously 
Michael Lu: okay 
Daniel Lu: And the matter in which you responded showed to me apathy 
Michael Lu: how so? 
Daniel Lu: Its called reading between lines 
Michael Lu: well you read between the lines wrong 
Daniel Lu: Lemme explain 
Michael Lu: because saying "okay" is a neutral response, 
Daniel Lu: (Insert Default Response to a rather long rant) 
Michael Lu: that's not apathy people say "okay" regularly in a conversation does not suggest apathy 
Daniel Lu: So you're saying that by saying the regular "neutral" word while someone is basically losing their shit, suggests no apathy I had something else which explain delay

Conversation:
Michael Lu: hue what's the third paragraph of ur essay 
Daniel Lu: . Christian vs Muslim Trade 
Michael Lu: so... then what are your first two paragraphs? 
Daniel Lu: . Tell me yours when I tell mine 
Michael Lu: idk about 3rd im describing shift in attitudes for first two 
Daniel Lu: Ah shift? 
Michael Lu: ja 
Daniel Lu: Christian shift from Intolerance to Tolerance Muslims became anti trade more so in time 
Michael Lu: ja do you understand the last document i mean do have an idea on how to use it 
Daniel Lu: Its a Sharia court decision 
Michael Lu: bc it seems pretty useless ja i know 
Daniel Lu: Remember This echoes early christian If you read within Its basically a complete reversal 
Michael Lu: last document? maybe document 5, but document 7??? 
Daniel Lu: Document 5 is Scholar musing 
Michael Lu: i know 
Daniel Lu: Islamic court decision says weight more 
Michael Lu: weight? 
Daniel Lu: Scholar Musings < Court Decision 
Michael Lu: how so? 
Daniel Lu: Court Decision = Set Precedent Final Say 
Michael Lu: ja 
Daniel Lu: Scholar musing shows intellectual growth but only court final say show the real change I'm gonna offer an analogy 
Michael Lu: what is the real change? 
Daniel Lu: . 
Michael Lu: change to guild? change to not allow merchants to buy cotton first? 
Daniel Lu: You're going way too specific You can use that as an example But the main point is this 
Michael Lu: ik ik 
Daniel Lu: Islamic and Christian attitudes basically flipped 
Michael Lu: what's the "real change" described in doc 7 tho? 
Daniel Lu: Shift in mentality had Christian societies become the innovators It just states a decision The change happens in between the documents 
Michael Lu: oh 
Daniel Lu: Ok I've given way too much away Jk 
Michael Lu: but you didn't answer how you would use doc 7? 
Daniel Lu: ... Use Doc 7 as a final say On how Islamic view of trade had solidified Into the Early Christian view 
Michael Lu: but how does doc 7 describe that? 
Daniel Lu: . \Doc 7 shows a court decision right? 
Michael Lu: yes 
Daniel Lu: Now look in it WHat does it keep referencing Key words 
Michael Lu: referencing wat paying extra to outperform others? 
Daniel Lu: WE're talking about Doc 7 
Michael Lu: yes 
Daniel Lu: Now look at what they're saying beyond the guild Cotton yarn is _________________ when cotton yarn came, ______________ it together 
Michael Lu: buy it all together 
Daniel Lu: Ok now use that Now let me give you another example 
Michael Lu: muslim merchant coop? 
Daniel Lu: Key Word "Distributed" 
Michael Lu: equal distribution? 
Daniel Lu: . Distrubution of Wealth 
Michael Lu: . 
Daniel Lu: The contrast can be seen there Then compare with the latest Christian document 
Michael Lu: ya think i can argue christianity had a bigger flip than islam? 
Daniel Lu: Sure go ahead Although I would do something different 
Michael Lu: wut 
Daniel Lu: You can twist any shit pile you see and twist it the way you want it to be like 
Michael Lu: cool wut u do? they flip equal to become oppposite? 
Daniel Lu: . To make a pile of shit look like gold Manipulate statistics Take whats true and twist it to fit your needs Its an axiom And I'm sure that has been put in application plenty of time 
Michael Lu: so... wat's ur thesis? 
Daniel Lu: . Tell me yours after I tell mine 
Michael Lu: i did 
Daniel Lu: Shifting attitudes of religious view on trade have wider reaching effects 
Michael Lu: christianity had bigger shift wat 
Daniel Lu: Islamic and Christian role reversal had revebrating effect on history Thats what I view as important ................. 
Michael Lu: is that ur thesis? 
Daniel Lu: For now it is 
Michael Lu: ok kewl 
Daniel Lu: Also Just saying I'm trying to figure how to have a sprite hold a gun Annnnd luckily there is a gun script that someone has conveniently wrote I didn't copy paste any of it though I had *Inspiration* Hehehehe Unfortunantely The Graphics will suck Since I'm not willing to design walls to correspond with the background The main problem for me though is to find how to move each sprite individually by triggering a key Which I found to be rather irritating Although if I were solely interested in passing the expectations, I could just add in the background music and the win screen, completing the background test for viability Hehehe Either that or I could just have one guy trying to mow down 19 But that would require an automatic script Which would be historically inaccurate 
Michael Lu: learn how to program bots 
Daniel Lu: . I'm using scratch Though 
Michael Lu: i know 
Daniel Lu: I have cpus just move in linear fashion But I'm trying to find how to get the 4 allies to shoot on their own 
Michael Lu: program them as bots 
Daniel Lu: Hmmmm Yea good idea Can't believe I didn't think about that Because as of now, each movement of the keys have all 5 of the team move in sync Which causes complete disarray Hmmmmm I might as well attach a little installation onto the sprite After all they don't need to be moved at all 
Michael Lu: when is this project due? 
Daniel Lu: is tommorow 
Michael Lu: lol 
Daniel Lu: So yea Right now I only have a half functioning thing 
Michael Lu: git it done m8 
Daniel Lu: If I'm desperate I make it a FPS 
Michael Lu: so violent 
Daniel Lu: Theres no gore 
Michael Lu: that is irrelevant 
Daniel Lu: If the invader is struck with bullet The invader is vaporized 
Michael Lu: lol PG ftw 
Daniel Lu: And bullet is cloned back to the gun starting position And there was also one other stage where I planned Mongol Balls to start charging down Ok its fundamentally restructured now Ok they all have these black slots Where the bullets shoot from Time to implement clone Hehe Woah this actually worked out better than I thought The fluke allowed me to control all 5 without any difficulty Hehehe Time to see if I can implement onto Mongols

Conversation:
Haijia Wang: Hey Michael do you know what the two vectors u and v are? Iâm kinda confused by the way they explained this 
Michael Lu: Yeah So for a given line signent of the hitbox Which is a square There is ve1 which goes from zookeeper center to endpoint of line segment And ve2 which goes from zookeeper center to other endpoint of line segment Vray is the vector that is the aiming direction So angles between ve1 and ve2 must equal angle between ve1 and vray + angle between vray and ve2 ve1 and ve2 are vectors btw Theta u v means the angle between any vectors u and v

Haijia Wang: This is so late BUT TY I never quite figured it out but itâs okay Also are you in Boston rn?

Michael Lu: In Connecticut rn Snow is not accumulating So not too bad Also I think Boston isnât snowing until after dark Might be more sleet tho 
Haijia Wang: Ohh alright thanks All earlier buses were sold out So mine is 4:30 from New York 
Michael Lu: Aight aight 
Haijia Wang: Which might be kinda risky Bc itâs started in New York already and Boston time will be like 8 pm so ð Hopefully it will be okay

Michael Lu: lol aight aight 


Conversation:
Haijia Wang: Hey Michael did you get here? 
Michael Lu: yeah what's up 
Haijia Wang: Do you know how it works Iâm confused by the questions Like feature 0-1 Digits 0,1? Like what is the line that exectures this 
Michael Lu: digits 0 1 
Haijia Wang: Oh So I tried And Got that so I am c confused ð 
Michael Lu: under #HINT: change the [0] Try
acc = hw3.get_classification_accuracy(raw_mnist_features(data), labels)
print(acc) don't call perceptron maybe 
Haijia Wang: Wait in A it says run perceptron So thatâs why I called perceptron Should we avoid that 
Michael Lu: try commenting it out and running the answer should be [0.975, 0.864, 0.948, 0.647] so check to make sure your accuracies match up if it's close enough it should also be good enough tho 
Haijia Wang: Yea I j got that Wait is it just me or are the instructions Lowkey a bit confusing lol 
Michael Lu: no they def are i ask boh allens for help all the time !!! especially for the google colab coding part, i never understand the instructions 
Haijia Wang: ð I used this call 
Michael Lu: they're telling u to generate 3 accuracies and in each one, call a different data modification method so first one should be row_average_features, then col_average_features, then top_bottom_features you don't have to call raw_mnist_features anymore and you should get [0.48, 0.64, 0.482] if the last accuracy is off, your code might be buggy 
Haijia Wang: Hmm thatâs what I tried running ð oh man okay Iâll try to fix my code 
Michael Lu: if you already got credit for that method though i think you can click view answer and copy the answer code otherwise, just use [0.48, 0.64, 0.482] 
Haijia Wang: Ohh Okay got it Thanks Oh wait UR RIGHT thatâs big brain 
Michael Lu: yes ma'ammmmm yah if u need any help any time lmk :D 
Haijia Wang: Wait their solution was the exact same LOLL 
Michael Lu: oh rlly? 
Haijia Wang: But yeeee ty very much 
Michael Lu: lmao yeah i'll be back at BC in a bit too 


Conversation:
Haijia Wang: did you look at this weeks 036 hw yet? 
Michael Lu: Yes maâam Wadd up 
Haijia Wang: Did u do 3.2 Iâm kinda confused about the q And is x the input or it contains parameters we need to use? And their hint Lowkey confused me more Bc I didnât really put anything outside of def gd 
Michael Lu: So the point of 3.2 is to create a function that returns a gradient vector And given ,, a column vector of inputs given x To create that gradient 
Haijia Wang: Ohhh 
Michael Lu: For each value in x, use the formula they provided You need to use. A for loop Ummm The hint idk what it rlly means, so I just copied X using x.copy() And stored it in x_copy variable and used that in my code 
Haijia Wang: Wait why do you need copies of x 
Michael Lu: Idk I think itâs because with each iteration of the for loop x might be accidentally modified So u copy it before the for loop 
Haijia Wang: And then we merge it for all the dimensions later? 
Michael Lu: Wdym 
Haijia Wang: Bc each iteration is for one specific dimension right? 
Michael Lu: Yes So I just appended to an array called red Res And result And then returned result in df Lmk if U want my code To understand What I mean 
Haijia Wang: Ahhh that makes a lot more sense imma try, tyyy 
Michael Lu: Yeah lmk if u need anything else for this PSet Iâll be in B4 for a bit too if u need anything 
Haijia Wang: Oohhh okay tyy!! I think I am definitely understanding this function wrong lol ð my understanding was we would only have one dimension Bc column vector has only one element so we should be returning only one value But instead we are returning multiple 
Michael Lu: You should be returning a column vector Make sure grad has the right parenthesis so ur dividing the entire expression by 2*delta Also cast result as a bumpy vector when I return it Lmk if that does anything Also lmk what the error msg is If itâs still there after the changes 


Conversation:
Haijia Wang: hey did you get a chance to do the week 6 036 hw yet? alsoo did you get back to ny safely? 
Michael Lu: yeh what's up r u in NJ? 
Haijia Wang: yesss, in my room in quarantine loll my side of the floor has been wrapped in plastic no joke so i am literally trapped behind sheets of plastic but how you doing? 
Michael Lu: lol do u need 036 stuffs? 
Haijia Wang: i finished like all the parts except for 1.1D and the ones that depend on that bc i keep getting the answer wrong wait am i doing something wrong? let me send you what i have right no *now 
Michael Lu: did u accoutn for the sigmoid derivative? You should get (a_1-y)*x_1 i looked at the previous homeworks 
Haijia Wang: i didn't account for the sigmoid but if i did, wouldn't their be a "e" in there? 
Michael Lu: i think this might help from previous hw do/dx = o * (1 - o) * x you never have to substitute in e, if you just use the derivative from the previous hw 
Haijia Wang: ohh okay that makes a lot more sense thanks michael!! 
Michael Lu: yepp np stay alive during ur quarantine ððð 
Haijia Wang: tyyy, you too pls !!! 


Conversation:
Haijia Wang: did you do 036 exercises for this week? (2E) im not sure why it's not 51 
Michael Lu: Lol itâs 0 
Haijia Wang: whaaa 
Michael Lu: Max pooling layers donât need weights Because they just take the max value 
Haijia Wang: but like if there's 50 outputs, and we want those 50 outputs to be fully connected 
Michael Lu: Like they donât rlly modify the inputs numerically 
Haijia Wang: dont we need 50 weights oh is it saying like from input to output? i thought it was implying we were connecting the outputs of the max pool layer in a fully connected layer 
Michael Lu: Not with a max pooling filter Thereâs no connection rlly because there are no weights I guess 
Haijia Wang: oh rip :( i think i understand, i misunderstood the problem, bc i thought they were asking if we put a fully connected layer after the max pool, how many weights we would need 
Michael Lu: Yeah same lol And then I guessed 0 
Haijia Wang: LOL ahh okay thanks this makes more sense now 
Michael Lu: Yuppppp 


Conversation:
Haijia Wang: ahh another 036 question did you do the exercises for this week alr nvr minddd lolll 


Conversation:
Haijia Wang: heyy question, im rlly stuck on 5.2 in the hw, do you think you can helppp? totally fine if you're busy 
Michael Lu: basically the psuedo code from the notes lmk if u want me to expliain any parttsss 
Haijia Wang: ohh okay ty, i had smth similar except for the innermost for loop i tried doing a lambda function and using the expection in DDist but you didnt use expectation 
Michael Lu: Yeah idk what expectation does 
Haijia Wang: do you like implificitly solve for expectation using the probability and the exp value 
Michael Lu: Whatâs expectation 
Haijia Wang: is the probability the probability of a transition ? in the get all probs function taht you call expectation = exp value + prob of value summed over all possibilities 
Michael Lu: Oh it gets the transition matrix 
Haijia Wang: oops * not + 
Michael Lu: The inner mist loop 
Haijia Wang: ohh so essentially, it returns the probability of moving to another transition 
Michael Lu: just calculates the value of the sum sigma probability Sigma (prob of transition) * (max reward for max action) 
Haijia Wang: ohh that makes sense, ig it isnt necessary to use expectation, bc i was trying to use that function but wasnt working out. and i didnt realize that they had these other funcs/what they did rip tyyy that makes a lot more sense. it's essentially doing the q update in the pseudocode step 
Michael Lu: Yeah same Expectation was too confusing to use

Hannah Zhong: yo did tria give u a 0 for outside info 
Michael Lu: Dam right and I died :((( 40/50 I thought "inventory" was figurative. 
Hannah Zhong: Same dude wtf on my essay she even wrote rich in outside info I got 38/40 
Michael Lu: Ikr same 
Hannah Zhong: Ugh fuck Can we complain coz srsly wtf 
Michael Lu: Idk can we 
Hannah Zhong: Inventory of outside info just means use of outside info who would go ask about that And she didn't even tell us Like wtf all the info is in the essay why do u want us to rewrite it holy shit I fcking can't stand her bullshit it was more than us 
Michael Lu: Yah who actually wrote out. 
Hannah Zhong: Like I bet a bunch of ppl too Jen did 
Michael Lu: The info 
Hannah Zhong: but like no one else I know of It's fucking stupid 
Michael Lu: T H I S  I S  B S 
Hannah Zhong: Yo I need those points We should complain literally everyone got a zero 
Michael Lu: I mean she'd get pissed And not curve the next test 
Hannah Zhong: Then calmly talk to her about it Lol the test avg would prob be around a 60 anyway she has to curve Coz this is actually fucking bullshit 
Michael Lu: Okay 
Hannah Zhong: actually now that I think about it inventory means like kinda storage but fucking still U can't say rich in outside info and give me a fucking zero on a section about outside info uhggsh FUCK FUCK 
Michael Lu: Yeah tbh on the day of the AP im not writing the essay like what she wants Because to have an "inventory" is bs and impractical 
Hannah Zhong: yea tf man all the info is in my head I literally wrote it in my essay and now u want me to write the same bullshit over again i think her essay style isn't too bad she's jus too picky Like ur supposed to prepare us for the AP Do u kno who else got a zero 
Michael Lu: Neves Anthony Zhou John Manuparambil Keerthi Kenneth Tab Kathleen Lu The ppl that did write it that I know from my class are probably just Chloe and Marianna Vargas 
Hannah Zhong: uhhh fuck marianas smart Same w chloe I just kno Jen wang did Maybe William cai I bet like the majority of the 23 apush students she has didn't do it And everyone got dicked on she can't do nothing right 
Michael Lu: Lol

Michael Lu: Hey... If you want to get back some points, go over your essay with Tria and maybe she'll return some pity points like she did with Anthony Hou.

Conversation:
Hannah Zhong: hey I have a question for nhd I wanna change my topic but idk if it counts as conflict and compromise so basically it's the birth control movement like the conflict would be women didn't have control over their pregnancies and t negatively affected their health and population control and compromise would be Margaret sangers birth control movement which eventually legalized birth control pills and abortion but it's more of like taking a stand than conflict and compromise 
Michael Lu: Conflict between whom Women vs who/what? 
Hannah Zhong: society that doesn't agree w contraception 
Michael Lu: It could probably work 
Hannah Zhong: they thought it wasn't moral and inappropriate 
Michael Lu: But youâd have to narrow it down to like a specific context 
Hannah Zhong: like ts not really compromise I was thinking focus on some Supreme Court cases 
Michael Lu: Yeah that could work. As long as you can select a certain time period and certain movement it should be fine 
Hannah Zhong: like one Supreme Court case or could I still focus on the general birth control movement coz there's a lot of important Supreme Court cases I don't think one would be enough 
Michael Lu: Well what time period is this 60s) ? 
Hannah Zhong: yea mid to late 1900s 
Michael Lu: Is it one continuous movement? 
Hannah Zhong: I guess yea 
Michael Lu: Ask Ms. Tria It seems good enough as a topic. 
Hannah Zhong: I already changed my topic twice rip I think she'll be mad I guess I'll go along w it 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Hannah Zhong: she's scary af 
Michael Lu: Yeah ð

Hannah Zhong: if it's on that Eisenhower thing what could be a concession like they wanted to get rid of communism but in the process they also supported corrupt dictators or is that a stretch or eisenhowers asministration didn't do much to improve tensions 
Michael Lu: Both could work Like Eisenhower supported dictators in Guatemala and Nam But couldnât prevent the stuff happening in Cuba And worsened tensions after that U2 Plane was shot down 
Hannah Zhong: I think the fact that he didn't improve much is a stronger concession 
Michael Lu: Ya Tru 
Hannah Zhong: it better be on that Eisenhower shit I swear to fucking god

Michael Lu: My code from last year Maybe I did right it myself ð¤ I thin you need to iterate i1 and i2 independently Nested while loops? Wait shit Mine is recursive lol whatevs so is urs 
Hannah Zhong: mine is recursive too? yea lol 
Michael Lu: Go Do 
Hannah Zhong: wait i donât get what wrong w mine i would like to learn a little 
Michael Lu: Iâm just guessing but Ur incrementations of i1 and i2 Are in if statements Whereas mine are in while statements So I increment my left all the way until I find some element thatâs not supposed to be where it is relative to pivot Whereas you increment ur left and right once for every iteration for the big for loop Idfk 
Hannah Zhong: idfk either i changed them to while loops and it still ainât working:( 
Michael Lu: Fix the other if statements Meaning take em out And copy my code Idek Dude just copy my code Lol

Jamie Fu: i don't understand you michael but that's ok 


Conversation:
Jamie Fu: michael on a scale of 1 to 10 how easy are your starter tasks going to be for you because i didn't know you were getting assigned to it so i built the starter tasks for people who didn't know react 
Michael Lu: Yeah um I donât know react : D 
Jamie Fu: wait actually? 
Michael Lu: Well I know react 
Jamie Fu: jianna just told me u know it very well 
Michael Lu: Well thatâs very flattering ð What makes her think that 
Jamie Fu: i have no clue she just said u do know it anyways what i'm saying is if the starter tasks take u like a day please come back for more because there's plenty i could assign lmao 
Michael Lu: Aigh aigh bet 
Jamie Fu: i am a sad non-js knowing non-react knowing child and therefore i don't fuck with any of dev's frontend work as of now lmfao 
Michael Lu: o rlly? :o Wait who else does spectacular 
Jamie Fu: sadly yes i can read someone else 's code and understand it and i did an itty bitty tutorial over self isolation period but sadly that is it if i end up doing nothing over the summer 
Michael Lu: F 
Jamie Fu: i should learn react lol eh i should learn it at some point 
Michael Lu: Wait just learn it thru Hack Itâs not terrible 
Jamie Fu: umm so jianna julia jack justin and i worked on it last semester 
Michael Lu: Itâs like if HTML and Java had a baby 
Jamie Fu: LOL interesting way of putting it i was going to try to do more react work for spectacle yeah 
Michael Lu: ^ I like that idea 
Jamie Fu: idk if i'll be maintainer for it anymore tho idk if justin and jack will continue to work on it jianna is p interested init and idk if julia will switch or not 
Michael Lu: Hmm maybe if u want to learn react you should look into some of the dev starter tasks for Spectacular They seem pretty React heavy ;) 
Jamie Fu: LOL ok michael i see what u did there ok you know what by thursday evening my life will be statistically more in control that it is atm so at that point i will in fact take on something react for spectacle thank u for the motivation to uphold this 
Michael Lu: ððð 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Wait are dev tasks due tonight or next meeting? 
Jamie Fu: 14th 
Michael Lu: Whatever you do Donât make the task too hard 
Jamie Fu: yes sir what do u want to do for spectacle i can align it to what you're interested in 
Michael Lu: Oh idk 
Jamie Fu: lol alright also when u get spectacle set up will u document all the things u need to setup we're trying to make our documentation better + troubleshooting things 
Michael Lu: Is that a task? :o 
Jamie Fu: lol consider it one what device r u working on 
Michael Lu: Surface pro 
Jamie Fu: LMAO nice are u gonna do the setup on a *nix distribution on that or just windows it's actually harder to do on macs so either waay u won't run into some big problems 
Michael Lu: Whatâs nix? Is that some Linux mumbo jumbo 
Jamie Fu: LOL like unix linux cuz like ain't nobody know wtf cmd does me doing powershell over iap was probably the worst experience of my life lmao but like basically nix os make developing way easier cuz terminal commands work really easy and git isn't a mess wait but here's my rundown of what the move is: download ubuntu wsl (windows subsystem for linux?) and then it's basically like a mini os on top of windows and u can develop from there or i think git bash works fine too? 
Michael Lu: So Iâm just gonna use cmd if thatâs aight 
Jamie Fu: lol if it works for you then it works for me how do u know how to use it tho that's wild 
Michael Lu: I had to use Mac terminal over IAP when I didnât know how to use a Mac, git, or terminal Lol I donât I just know how to use stack overflow 
Jamie Fu: LMAO that's just called being big brain Eek That's the moce move 
Michael Lu: ð¥ ð¥ð¥ 
Jamie Fu: Lmk how it goes lol I don't think anybody's set it up on Windows yet 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Bro whatâs make 
Jamie Fu: When u set up a program for the first time sometimes there's a makefile which specifies commands to run to make sure your environment is set up And it installs dependencies Depending on what the command after make is too 
Michael Lu: Would it install both the python and node dependencies at the same time? like âmake installl â 
Jamie Fu: Uh depends on whats in the makefile but it'd probably check for them and install if u didn't have Do u have the virtualenv set up 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Jamie Fu: Yeah make install should install node js If u don't have it alreafy 
Michael Lu: And requirements.txt? 
Jamie Fu: Yeah the makefile pulls info from requirements.txt 
Michael Lu: Is make required to be used by all hack dev ppl Like is make references in all read me strips Setups 
Jamie Fu: No Jason was just Fancy 
Michael Lu: Who dat 
Jamie Fu: He's an alum Who started spectacle 
Michael Lu: Jason Kung? 
Jamie Fu: Yeah 
Michael Lu: O dat boi interviewed me V big man 
Jamie Fu: Lol Jason's great 
Michael Lu: Speaking of âVâ Wtf is âviâ 
Jamie Fu: Even tho he's all washed he still comes to all the hack stuff Lmao vi is like A barebones text editor Not even barebones But it's like vim Which is a command line text editor 
Michael Lu: So how is it used as a command e.g. âvi server/config.pyâ Can I just âpythonâ dat config 
Jamie Fu: so any time you write vi or vim follwed by a file you're asking it to open that file in those text editors if you do python "dat config" you'll try to run the file with python you don't have to use vim yu can just open the file locally in any editor to edit it 
Michael Lu: config.py doesnât even exist Rip 
Jamie Fu: it's a config.example file at first i thought if i remember then you need to modify it into a config.py 
Michael Lu: At first :o Ohhh Once u configure the credentials 
Jamie Fu: yeah 
Michael Lu: You re-save it as a python file? Why not just make it a python file at first tho? 
Jamie Fu: not sure u can i guess 
Michael Lu: Br 
Jamie Fu: i think it's just to make sure u don't try to run the program with a dummy config 
Michael Lu: Uh Regardless I need the config vars tho 
Jamie Fu: oh yeah yeah let me go find mine DEBUG=True

Michael Lu: Lmao I donât This bothers me Ur that kinda guy huh 
Jamie Fu: Ts p clean I used to be the exact opposite of that guy And then the emails kept coming So it was useless to mark them as read Piazza emails are there for the sentiment yanno 
Michael Lu: how long would it take you to mark them all as read tho or maybe you should just leave it like that for 4+ years and read them all at graduation 
Jamie Fu: this life is all about time spent sir tbh i've given up it's the aesthetic now same with the gmail inbox that one makes the unread ones more obvious so i usually mass mark them as read but there's so much junk in there that i need to delete that i just don't lol did u just presume it would take >4 years for me to graduate 
Michael Lu: Idk MEng or no MEng Lol Ur a monster ðð 
Jamie Fu: your usage of emojis startles me lol do u text jianna a lot wait do mengs attend two graduations or just oe one 
Michael Lu: ð¤·ââï¸only one way to find out Whenever I need to ask if a Hack Meeting is âoptionalâ 
Jamie Fu: omg your use of emojis is similar and creepy also hack meetings are never optional you should come to all of them!!!! all of this week's committee meetings were on tuesday this week lol it was a lot of hack in one day 
Michael Lu: Lol rlly ððð 
Jamie Fu: oh no 
Michael Lu: ð¡ Lmao explanation pls

Michael Lu: O lol sounds traumatizing ððð 
Jamie Fu: omg please are u west coast 
Michael Lu: LMFAO Do I give of west coast vibes? Is this a complement?

Jamie Fu: hi so your next tasks for spectacle are to build a logout button, show a countdown for when submission due, and implement the search bar with filters for some of the things submitted in project details also do u want to do any backend work like flask endpoints cuz i was gonna have jianna do the set submission deadline in the settings table as a couple of endpoints but she has some frontend changes to make on the admin panel and julia needs that endpoint as well so it'd be nice to have that earlier than later 
Michael Lu: F I got a task

Jamie Fu: You can do it like soft or hard deadline but we really only need one Wait the endpoints for setting deadlines? 
Michael Lu: O endpoints Thereâs a An endpoint to update settings in general R u saying u want separate endpoints for each deadline? 
Jamie Fu: Hmmm No that's fine for now then Let me talk to jianna about the admin panel first then

Jaysen Zhang: :| whats that supposed to mean 
Michael Lu: idk 
Jaysen Zhang: fk it im going to robotics and/or programming club and hunting you down 
Michael Lu: *gasp* you know too much O_o wait how did you harass that kid 
Jaysen Zhang: "that kid" aka you like i went up to him saying how scioly was going to be announced and that i didnt know your sister was emma and he's like holy shit im not micheal im david so #1 tip it might be you cuz his friend right next to him's name is david and then later i went up to him like hey michael and he (you) responded so like pretty sure his real name's michael 
Michael Lu: "his?" so he said he was michael? 
Jaysen Zhang: i dk i cant trust you anymore

Michael Lu: My sister saw you at Columbia. Speaking of Columbia, were the challenge Math section questions of the Columbia SHP test as difficult as the harder or easier type AMC 10 questions. 
Jaysen Zhang: lmao i saw her too :| i dont even know her from what i can tell they pretty much rip it from a previous amc10 they're about questions 8-18 difficulty i would say but this was three years ago but i know the year after i took it they used the same questions pretty much if you took alg2 and geo i think you're good

it's bullshit how everything in javascript is a var
and how you can convert an int-type var into a string-type var by adding an empty string
and how there is = and == but also === it's honestly so fake 
Michael Lu: yes and stfu

Michael Lu: :p 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Did u finish da thingy 
Jeffery Tse: lol i should be done... but i didn't finish... i've been procrastinating and my program isn't gonna be good idek how to make it good and like all smart and stuff if you want though, you could ask kyle choi 
Michael Lu: idk kyle choi tho 
Jeffery Tse: i think he would be glad to share his bot i'll introduce 
Michael Lu: lol it's alright don't worry about it :P 
Jeffery Tse: is yours rlly good? 
Michael Lu: No Jen beat mine 
Jeffery Tse: lol did you ask anthony xiang? 
Michael Lu: No 
Jeffery Tse: his program is interesting... simple htough idk if he changed it 
Michael Lu: I mean Heâs a math god 
Jeffery Tse: but he's lazy and doesn't try in this class...idk he doesn't seem that good in comp sci 
Michael Lu: Heâs also a senior :p 
Jeffery Tse: yeah hey, what does your bot do? my bot is basically random based off of your last move like i would have to know other people's strategies in order to counter them i don't rlly get this project... 
Michael Lu: Lol the thing is due It basically did pattern prediction And throwing to counter ur most frequent throws 
Jeffery Tse: ic but what if someone else does that too? cuz that method seems common 
Michael Lu: Lol idk 
Jeffery Tse: have you tried putting yourself against yourself? 
Michael Lu: Yeah I forgot what happen 
Jeffery Tse: you won that's what happened 
Michael Lu: Lol XD 


Conversation:
Jeffery Tse: hey micheal, for the lab, how do you know if the spring is hookean? 
Michael Lu: Erin I think the distance and force have a linear relationship 
Jeffery Tse: ok... 
Michael Lu: Is this the relationship u got 
Jeffery Tse: uhm yeah m = (kx)/(2g) you're missing hte "/" also for question 2 idk what you did i just left it as m = (k/(2g))x i don't get the change in y and change in x = k(2g) 
Michael Lu: Wot 
Jeffery Tse: what's your question? part 1 is right but you're just missing the "/" 
Michael Lu: Yah 
Jeffery Tse: part 2 idk whatyou did idk why have the change in y and x 
Michael Lu: Whatâs the expression for ur slope 
Jeffery Tse: isn't it just k/2g 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Jeffery Tse: ok well why do you have that stuff for your question 2 
Michael Lu: It means x is X 
Jeffery Tse: delta y over delta x 
Michael Lu: y is m 
Jeffery Tse: i get that part just the delta stuff 
Michael Lu: And the slope delta y over delta x is k/2g 
Jeffery Tse: ooohhhhh omg lol why didn't you just write slope...ok i get it now 
Michael Lu: Idk :p 
Jeffery Tse: but idk what it means by graphing that relationship 
Michael Lu: U graph The linearilzidd 
Jeffery Tse: but what's k? how would u graph that equation wihtout numbers? i don't get it 
Michael Lu: Is this part of the lab? 
Jeffery Tse: what? number 3 
Michael Lu: You graph ur data 
Jeffery Tse: graph the previous equation 
Michael Lu: Graph data points 
Jeffery Tse: why doesn't it say that thennnnomg... 
Michael Lu: Idk 
Jeffery Tse: btw, wat do you do with the y intercept for both graphs? also for spring constant for santa...i got 176966 N/m... is that too high??? wait nvm, the mass should be in kg right? wait then why isn't the other things in kg? 
Michael Lu: what? 
Jeffery Tse: like the weights for the spring 
Michael Lu: idk just change it to kg 
Jeffery Tse: is it supposed to be kg? 
Michael Lu: should ber 
Jeffery Tse: ok hey, for the max speed of the santa, what formula did you use? did you use dynamics? 
Michael Lu: I did energy conservation 
Jeffery Tse: how? what your h? how did you find h 
Michael Lu: H is the spring compression 
Jeffery Tse: so you're basically finding the speed after the spring is relaxed? 
Michael Lu: Yeah thatâs when all spring potential is used 
Jeffery Tse: ok ic cool did you put (0,0) as a point for both graphs? sot hat they don't have a y int? 
Michael Lu: I just used y ~ mx in desmos So the best fit line just have a slope 
Jeffery Tse: oh. ic coolio hey micheal, jeremy brought up a point for the last question you know how you added gravitational potential energy for the santa at the relaxed position but in that position, the spring, attached to the santa, should still be on the ground so does it still gain that gravitational potential energy? 
Michael Lu: Fuq Ur right Lol I got it from Jen 
Jeffery Tse: no idk though does it still gain potential??? 
Michael Lu: Maybe 
Jeffery Tse: holyy 
Michael Lu: Whatevs Iâm just doing ur way 
Jeffery Tse: rlly? 
Michael Lu: Usp = KE ? 
Jeffery Tse: uh yeah if you leave out u

Michael Lu: Based on the drawing 
Jeffery Tse: oh oh oh so you see how the lines don't intersect after it bounces 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Jeffery Tse: like there's no way they intersect so then you extent the lines 
Michael Lu: Besides behind the mirror yah 
Jeffery Tse: yeah yeah 
Michael Lu: But how does that relate to being upright and magnified 
Jeffery Tse: well it's upright because it is and magnified because it is it's bigger and it's not inverted 
Michael Lu: How do you know that Based on the drawing tho 
Jeffery Tse: you see it after you draw it 
Michael Lu: See what

Jennifer Luo: 7 It's fine Ethan is on it Such a god 
Michael Lu: Tell him I said hi The projectile problem??? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah 
Michael Lu: Just do kinetic energy equation But sub in component of velocity in x direction 
Jennifer Luo: What 
Michael Lu: Velocity = Given speed * cos(angle) Plug velocity into Ek = 1/2 * m * v^2 
Jennifer Luo: Fuckkkk 
Michael Lu: :(( 
Jennifer Luo: I just overcomplicated things Kwnsmdnddndksnf 
Michael Lu: Did u get it? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah Ethan got it before you explain :PP

Conversation:
Jennifer Luo: :((( I wanted to sit next to you T^T 
Michael Lu: Lol itâs okay :)) I still had fun 
Jennifer Luo: It works :))) I like your letter too :)) 
Michael Lu: For the math proof What were the comments about the domain and range and triangle you made? 
Jennifer Luo: I just said that based on the range of the inverse function, y can only be in that range so like the sine is always positive The triangle was irrelevant lol Ended up excluding it from the prof Proof 
Michael Lu: Lol ok Thx 
Jennifer Luo: Np~ 
Michael Lu: Do u wanna do escape the room over break? 
Jennifer Luo: Yahhh I wanna Oh is that why you bumped? 
Michael Lu: Yeah Idk who else wants to go tho

Michael Lu: Lol well we clearly already lost Yam and Wang 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah lol 
Michael Lu: Should I ask in the group 
Jennifer Luo: I guess 
Michael Lu: Should we add Jen Wang back

Conversation:
Michael Lu: Lol I forgot to ask How was ur writing conference? 
Jennifer Luo: Okay 
Michael Lu: :pp 
Jennifer Luo: :PP

Michael Lu: Wait whatâs ânormalâ? 
Jennifer Luo: Like 12:30 lol 
Michael Lu: lol ok 


Conversation:
Jennifer Luo: For number 3 Why is the answer positive 
Michael Lu: It added work into the system so Bart ended up with a higher final speed. 
Jennifer Luo: Oh I thought it took away since it pushes up 
Michael Lu: ? 
Jennifer Luo: Like To go downwards you need to have a force pushing up? Like It's not pushing down 
Michael Lu: But what does that do to the sign? 
Jennifer Luo: Make I  negative *it Because it would be going against the direction of motion 
Michael Lu: â¤ Oops 
Jennifer Luo: What Lol 
Michael Lu: Misclick XD Lemme think Okay I think the physics surfing Is basically like riding a roller coaster 
Jennifer Luo: But when you ride a roller coaster Friction is negative 
Michael Lu: Yeah but he gets pushed by the water forward or something I guess 
Jennifer Luo: Oh..... Idgi 
Michael Lu: So like, forget about directions and all that stuff for a sec If you disregard the non conservative force, Bart should finish with a speed of 6.39 m/s 
Jennifer Luo: Oh So he has to gain energy Because he ended up with a higher velocity 
Michael Lu: Yeah, some force ADDED energy into the system Yahh 
Jennifer Luo: Oh :(( Sighsss ;-; 
Michael Lu: :(( what 
Jennifer Luo: I'm gonna faillllllll 
Michael Lu: Youâve never gotten below a 70 on a physics test Therefore you have bever failed 
Jennifer Luo: But I'm going to tomorrow It'll be my first one 
Michael Lu: >:((((( 
Jennifer Luo: :<<<< 
Michael Lu: Water u sayin 
Jennifer Luo: I'm saying I'm going to meet my death tomorrow

Jennifer Luo: Idk Are you still buffing it up! ? If you want you can email him 
Michael Lu: ;P nah 
Jennifer Luo: Lol Oh shit I almost forgot about the lab 
Michael Lu: ð 
Jennifer Luo: ;(( Youâre mean 
Michael Lu: :PP nah b 
Jennifer Luo: Hmph For the lab, is the maximum speed of the popper when the compression just becomes 0? 
Michael Lu: What does ur equation look like 
Jennifer Luo: Heh What equation 
Michael Lu: Like the setup to solve 
Jennifer Luo: I mean Donât I need to know where first! ? To make a setup 
Michael Lu: Energy conservation equation what is it? 
Jennifer Luo: ????????? Iâm so confused Like i know itâs energy conservation 
Michael Lu: Lol just send a pic of ur work 
Jennifer Luo: I donât have anyzzz 
Michael Lu: Oh. 
Jennifer Luo: Like I donât have a setup because I donât know where he max velocitynis 
Michael Lu: Thatâs what I did 
Jennifer Luo: Oh okay So I was right then 
Michael Lu: Okay ð 
Jennifer Luo: :)) thanks 
Michael Lu: Np~ 
Jennifer Luo: Oh wait No Thatâs not what I did... 
Michael Lu: Oh no 
Jennifer Luo: How is it possible to have only kinetic energy? Wouldnât it have to be with either one of the gravitational potential energies Whoops ignore gravitational 
Michael Lu: Wait Maybe 
Jennifer Luo: So I thought max would be like when itâs leaving the table 
Michael Lu: Ur right 
Jennifer Luo: So delta x is 0? And h would be the spring length? Is that right? 
Michael Lu: Show an equation setup 
Jennifer Luo: ? Oh but my values are diff lol 
Michael Lu: Wait donât u have Usp in the beginning 
Jennifer Luo: Oh I used the thing at max height You could use usp also Am I wrong! ? 
Michael Lu: Whatâs ur final answer 
Jennifer Luo: Oh didnât do it I was waiting to see if the setup was right :(( 2.896 Whatâd you get 
Michael Lu: With ur setup 3.11 
Jennifer Luo: Okey Wait did you get diff answer? Like when you use your setup Like with the usp 
Michael Lu: Yeah but I forgot about gravity 
Jennifer Luo: ?? Uh That answer Is very different Wait a second Your k value is tiny!!! Wtf I got 14.496 
Michael Lu: Whatâs ur max height 
Jennifer Luo: Avg 0.453 
Michael Lu: Lol ur right 
Jennifer Luo: ?? Idgiii What happened 
Michael Lu: 163.07 is new k 
Jennifer Luo: Oh okay So did your answer come out the same for the usp setup! ? 
Michael Lu: Yea 
Jennifer Luo: Yayyy 
Michael Lu: Did u 
Jennifer Luo: Oh I didnât do it lol Hold on 
Michael Lu: :p 
Jennifer Luo: Oh shit I didnât get the same answer I got 0.6 
Michael Lu: Did u factor in gravity 
Jennifer Luo: Heh ??? 
Michael Lu: Usp = Ke + Ug 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah I did 
Michael Lu: Whatâs ur k 
Jennifer Luo: 14.496 
Michael Lu: My k was 163 
Jennifer Luo: HUNDRED?? 
Michael Lu: Yeah :/// 
Jennifer Luo: Wtf Uh Whattttt Okay so m is 0.01?? Right 
Michael Lu: Ye 
Jennifer Luo: What was your compression 
Michael Lu: Its 0.025 m for all 
Jennifer Luo: Same Wtf Can I see your setup 
Michael Lu: I got 150.53 for u 
Jennifer Luo: Wtf Isnât it (2mg)/deltax^2 
Michael Lu: What about h 
Jennifer Luo: Whoops I meant 2mh Wait I meant 2mgh OHHHHH I FORGOT TO TYOE THE G GDARNNN I got 142 Okey Yeah ughhhh Wthhhh YAS okay I got the same answer Finallyyyyyy 
Michael Lu: Yay 
Jennifer Luo: Thank youuuuu 
Michael Lu: Np :))) 
Jennifer Luo: Also Donât forget to hand in comp sci lol Still due tomorrow 
Michael Lu: XD thx Do u have copay tmrw?

Jennifer Luo: I WANT TO KMS AND KILL THEM I just started studying lol Bc can wait lol Sleep can go to hell 
Michael Lu: :(( RIP 
Jennifer Luo: Rip sleep Rip my head Rip my throat Rip me 
Michael Lu: Aww Jen... (;_;)

Michael Lu: :/ Okay... Sry 
Jennifer Luo: ?? 
Michael Lu: I mean What did the stony person talk abt 
Jennifer Luo: I mean he pretty much talked about general stuff for like 10 min and then answered questions Stony has quite the distinguished math department And their comp sci they claim is top fibe Five Thooooo thatâs probs not true Anyways I went to stony cuz their math departments were really good My parents went to wash and chi lol 
Michael Lu: Woah cool beans ð¥ð¥ð¥ 


Conversation:
Jennifer Luo: Yikessssss Good luck lol 
Michael Lu: Still at the airport? 
Jennifer Luo: ????? Airport?? 
Michael Lu: nvm 
Jennifer Luo: ???????? 
Michael Lu: Didnt u say ur mom came back from something? 
Jennifer Luo: ??? What No 
Michael Lu: Ok... 
Jennifer Luo: What Iâm so confused 
Michael Lu: Nvm then 


Conversation:
Jennifer Luo: :(((((( Help plzzz :(( Ughhhhh I used 7 tried Tries Holy shit what wrong with me ;-; 
Michael Lu: Did u get it? I think you overshot it Itâs cm Mine was 2.7 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah I didnât get jt I donât know what Iâm doing wrong Did you do conservation of energize Energy? 
Michael Lu: Ye 
Jennifer Luo: Idgiiiii So usp = usp + ke + Ug? 
Michael Lu: Umm How many tries do I have left? U* 
Jennifer Luo: I have 3 :(( 
Michael Lu: Try 2.18 
Jennifer Luo: Itâs right.... Idgi 
Michael Lu: Usp = Ke Can u help #13 
Jennifer Luo: But thereâs still usp and Ug? Yeah 
Michael Lu: Not at its max speed 
Jennifer Luo: Answer is c Yeah? 
Michael Lu: And lowest point 
Jennifer Luo: Isnât max speed at equilibrium 
Michael Lu: Wait send a screen shot for 13 Iâd go Idgi 
Jennifer Luo: Just do the math 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Jennifer Luo: Or use reason I guess 
Michael Lu: Thx man :)) 
Jennifer Luo: Do you get it? 
Michael Lu: Yeah I thought 
Jennifer Luo: Okay 
Michael Lu: /\x was equal in B and C 
Jennifer Luo: Nah lol Wait I still donât get it tho 
Michael Lu: At max speed All Usp is Ke 
Jennifer Luo: So max speed is when itâs at the relaxed length??? 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Jennifer Luo: Tf 
Michael Lu: Max speed at x0 
Jennifer Luo: But what if it doesnât reach the relaxed length ?? I thought max speed was at the equilibrium lount Point Wait wouldnât x0 be the equilibrium in this case? Since itâs oscillating around that 
Michael Lu: Yeah max speed is at equilibrium Did I say lowest? Nvm that 
Jennifer Luo: So why are you ignoring Ug and usp 
Michael Lu: At equilibrium point Usp = 0 
Jennifer Luo: No?? Isnât that at the relaxed liunt Point Because thereâs a /\x at the point of equilibrium? 
Michael Lu: Equilibrium is relaxed Right? 
Jennifer Luo: What?? Idgi Isnât equilibrium when itâs stretched the x 
Michael Lu: Equilibrium is the point where the thingy stands still 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah 
Michael Lu: With the mass 
Jennifer Luo: So itâs not relaxed Itâs stretched 
Michael Lu: Okay ð 
Jennifer Luo: Whaaaaaaaat 
Michael Lu: I guess if u think of it that way Yeah 
Jennifer Luo: Idgi So why are you ignoring usp and ug If itâs stretched thereâs usp? And thereâs ug cuz itâs like moved vertically 
Michael Lu: Because we define x0 at the stretched rest point 
Jennifer Luo: But why 
Michael Lu: If u want Usp at that point u probably have to change x0 to be the ceiling 
Jennifer Luo: What 
Michael Lu: At equilibrium the thing is at rest right? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah 
Michael Lu: Thats x0 right 
Jennifer Luo: No? Isnât x0 relaxrd 
Michael Lu: Then that would be the spring length without the mass? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah? I did that 
Michael Lu: x = y 
Jennifer Luo: ? Why I donât get this photo... ;-; 
Michael Lu: Itâs in the notes hold on Err so a vertical spring oscillates exactly like a horizontal spring 
Jennifer Luo: And? Am I just stupid? ;-; 
Michael Lu: No Iâm trying to figure this formal definition out too :p 
Jennifer Luo: :(((((((((((((( If this is bothering you Iâll just ask wells tomorrow :(( 
Michael Lu: Nah itâs aiight 
Jennifer Luo: :(( 
Michael Lu: Lol itâs a long proof apparently 
Jennifer Luo: Whattt itâs fine sighs Iâll just ask him tomorrow then I guess 
Michael Lu: The work of gravity cancels out extra spring energy So it ends up being exactly like a horizontal spring 
Jennifer Luo: Idgi How come in all the other conservation problems that never happened 
Michael Lu: I mean Do you know when it did happen? 
Jennifer Luo: ? 
Michael Lu: Like did we ever have a vertical spring pulled down? 
Jennifer Luo: Iâm pretty sure? But even so like work of gravity isnât external? 
Michael Lu: Wdym 
Jennifer Luo: Like to the system? 
Michael Lu: Which system 
Jennifer Luo: Idk Iâm just confusing myself at this point Ugh You know what maybe Iâll look at this again tomorrow when Iâm not having a fever -.- 
Michael Lu: K Iâll keep on looking ð 
Jennifer Luo: Sorry :(( 
Michael Lu: :p 
Jennifer Luo: You donât have to you know You probably have a bunch of other shit to do :(( Oh :((( 
Michael Lu: ? 
Jennifer Luo: STILL DONT GET IT WOKENRMWRNKEWNIWKDJTJTJTN gives up on life Kms 
Michael Lu: Do u get the math part ? 
Jennifer Luo: Kinda 
Michael Lu: Which part is shady 
Jennifer Luo: The whole thing... 
Michael Lu: What about step 1 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah I got jay That 
Michael Lu: Step 2 
Jennifer Luo: No I mean like I get the math 
Michael Lu: Oh cool 
Jennifer Luo: I just like Donât get why it works 
Michael Lu: Conceptually? 
Jennifer Luo: Just Generally Yeah 
Michael Lu: Like if the spring force is the same vertically and horizontally as proved by maths Then gravity has no effect 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah um can you explain tomorrow morning I really just donât get it rn 
Michael Lu: K... 
Jennifer Luo: Sorry :(( I think my brain is melting Again Fucking fever came back 
Michael Lu: Aww :(( 
Jennifer Luo: ? Also ITS SNOWING School?

Michael Lu: âComplicatedâ? 
Jennifer Luo: Itâs complicated Very complicated Too complicated for me to explain

Conversation:
Michael Lu: Umm Can u like Help for computer sci I need to get the assignment done ASAP Need hints :D 
Jennifer Luo: Hi What do you need help with? 
Michael Lu: Where did u copy temp into array 
Jennifer Luo: Very end after the loop 
Michael Lu: In merge 
Jennifer Luo: So itâs the last thing in the method 
Michael Lu: Does it start with i = 0 
Jennifer Luo: No 
Michael Lu: Dafuq 
Jennifer Luo: You start at left1 Because that means youâre starting at the first element? 
Michael Lu: The copy loop 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah 
Michael Lu: Left1 
Jennifer Luo: Because temp is the same size as array Itâs not like just the section 
Michael Lu: So copy loop Stars at left1 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah 
Michael Lu: And ends at right2? 
Jennifer Luo: Yup 
Michael Lu: So Now my array is messed up 
Jennifer Luo: Idgi what happened 
Michael Lu: The elements are getting replaced with 0 idk Did you have an increment we for temp 
Jennifer Luo: We?? 
Michael Lu: Incrementer 
Jennifer Luo: Apparantly jennifer had a problem with the zeros too Oh Yeah In the copy loop? 
Michael Lu: Like those 3 variables: Incrementers for left, right, and temp 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah No 
Michael Lu: Lol what 
Jennifer Luo: The one for temp needs to also be left1 Youâre storing them in the same location Like itâs not an array with the size of the sections 
Michael Lu: Aight aight 
Jennifer Luo: Is it fixed? Like did it work 
Michael Lu: Is that the conprarison Comparison 
Jennifer Luo: Yup 
Michael Lu: Ok So thatâs my other thing That fills up the temp Once one incrementer goes out of bounds 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah But in your for loop It should be less than or equal to Right2 
Michael Lu: LIT Thx fam~~~~~~~ 
Jennifer Luo: Yayyy 
Michael Lu: \(~_~)/ Beautiful picture of beautiful man 
Jennifer Luo: Scioly? 
Michael Lu: To express my gratitude 
Jennifer Luo: He ditched math team cuz he didnât make the top team LOL 
Michael Lu: Lol I heard Lol aight thx Jen Good stuff 
Jennifer Luo: Np~ Lol Badda bing badda boom 
Michael Lu: hey can you do me a solid are you busy?

Michael Lu: Ok 
Jennifer Luo: :(( 
Michael Lu: Lemme ask somebody else Hollow shell ball? According to Patrick 
Jennifer Luo: Why tho Tf 
Michael Lu: no idea hold tight for 7f 
Jennifer Luo: ?? 
Michael Lu: idk why it's shell ball it's not same time help it's not cylinder 2 either 
Jennifer Luo: Hold on ISNT it 1?? Yeah I tried it just now Itâs 1 
Michael Lu: cylinder 1 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah 
Michael Lu: 10? did u finish yet 
Jennifer Luo: Iâm not even doing it rn... 
Michael Lu: oh lol 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah lol Did you try anything for 10 yet 
Michael Lu: should I ask somebody else? 
Jennifer Luo: Itâs fine 
Michael Lu: it's not equal and non zero or not enough info 
Jennifer Luo: Uh Itâs not the disk is greater Lol Tf idgi Ugh Wait would it be that the ring is greater? Doesnât it kinda make sense? 
Michael Lu: y 
Jennifer Luo: Higher I makes harder turn Aka slower Aka less a Aka less friction? Oh wait That doesnât make sense Tf But like Thereâs no way itâs 0 So that means it has to be the answer 
Michael Lu: hold on 
Jennifer Luo: :( 
Michael Lu: i suspect it's 0 getting andy 
Jennifer Luo: No way They be rolling LOL 
Michael Lu: well's will never suspect a thing when they're both rolling friction is 0 idk 
Jennifer Luo: Theyâre rolling tho They have to have friction No? Cuz theyâre accelerating? 
Michael Lu: idk nvm ring is greater i guess 
Jennifer Luo: Uh Better not risk it Tell Andy LOL 
Michael Lu: ring > disk 
Jennifer Luo: Okay 
Michael Lu: yep 6 ppl involved 
Jennifer Luo: LMFAO I lost power -.- Muy triggered 
Michael Lu: Wait actually? Lol feels bad

Michael Lu: Did u ask Joyce? 
Jennifer Luo: Um 
Michael Lu: Jk :p 
Jennifer Luo: Not funny ??? Why tho 
Michael Lu: If u use the floor as the pivot for both Then the bigger hoop has larger gravity force but higher moment of inertia to compensate He demoed this in class 
Jennifer Luo: Oh yeahhhhh Okay thanks 
Michael Lu: Np 
Jennifer Luo: helpppppppoo Number 9 plz 
Michael Lu: Hello 
Jennifer Luo: Help Halp Plz I asked somebody smart and he didnât reply :((( #feelsignored

Jennifer Luo: Okey thanks 


Conversation:
Jennifer Luo: Lol 
Michael Lu: ^ answers match yahoo But idk Nvm 
Jennifer Luo: Idgi Isnât it just (6.67 * 10^-11 * 6.2 * 6.2) / (0.3)^2 Nvm Iâm stupid I just calculated wrong Help Is it canât be calculated 
Michael Lu: I thought it was A 
Jennifer Luo: Whattt Why To maximize it would you want the radius to be smalle *smaller 
Michael Lu: The closer it is The faster it orbits The more KE less Ug Also Ug = -G * (M * m)/r Negative sign matters Bigger r makes it closer to 0, thus numerically greater 
Jennifer Luo: But the formula for Ug has r on the bottom So wouldnât a bigger r have a smaller Ug 
Michael Lu: but itâs negative 
Jennifer Luo: Oh wait yeahhh Wait Oh okay 
Michael Lu: Yupe 
Jennifer Luo: Do you have to fill in all three sections in the notecards 
Michael Lu: I did To be safÃ© 
Jennifer Luo: Okay

Jennifer Luo: Not at home rn Iâll send later Wait How do I send?? 
Michael Lu: Copy paste? Email files? Also, do you have the Koch snowflake done? 
Jennifer Luo: Iâm scratching that Jasonâs group is specifically doing the Koch snowflake So Iâm probably gonna do the tree 
Michael Lu: Wait man Iâm doing the tree 
Jennifer Luo: Oh Well Then what should I do then 
Michael Lu: Umm Some other 2D fractal? Something with circles? âHyperbolic tesselationsâ with sevenagons 
Jennifer Luo: Um What now Is that a fractal??? 
Michael Lu: Idk Kinda The pattern repeats 
Jennifer Luo: But itâs not technically a fractal I think? 
Michael Lu: Okay welp Idk then 
Jennifer Luo: Waittttttt Yeah theyâre tech not 
Michael Lu: Y :( 
Jennifer Luo: It says they technically arenât 
Michael Lu: Oh lol 
Jennifer Luo: Because the whole thing isnât being repeated right?? Just sections of it?? What about this one I meannnn Idk when Iâm gonna finish it thk Looks hella hard Anyways Iâll try I guess Wait so Which ones do we have so far Mandelbrot Sierpenski Tree 
Michael Lu: Triangle, square, Mandelbrot, random triangle 
Jennifer Luo: And tree? 
Michael Lu: Working on it 
Jennifer Luo: Ohh okay Oh also Did I tell you about weitingâs new info he gave me About the tissue box and the draw bridge 
Michael Lu: QÃÃ© 
Jennifer Luo: Oh So He had a tissue box attached to the bottom of the Pringle can And like it had a little slide in it for the egg to roll onto the floor And he lined it with sponges to absorb some impact And the thing he had inside the Pringle can was some kind of draw bridge made with like two rubber bands I has empty tissue boxes if you wanna use them 
Michael Lu: Wait can u draw a pic 
Jennifer Luo: Well you seee I donât exactly get it either He said heâd make me a drawing 
Michael Lu: Lol ok Weâll figure it out 
Jennifer Luo: But he mightâve forgot lol Iâll ask later I guess 
Michael Lu: Nah weâll think of something 
Jennifer Luo: Lol Btw the pentagon one is called sierpinski pentagon 
Michael Lu: What abt serpiebskis sevenagon 
Jennifer Luo: Um Are you sure itâs called a sevenagon Isnât it heptagon 
Michael Lu: Oh Okay the heptagon 
Jennifer Luo: And Iâm tempted to say itâs nonexistent?? Idk I canât find it 
Michael Lu: I looked it up 
Jennifer Luo: I found hexagon and octagon thk Tho So what should I do The pentagon? 
Michael Lu: Is that the hard snowflake picture thing 
Jennifer Luo: ??? 
Michael Lu: Å Ã® 
Jennifer Luo: So Iâll do this one? 
Michael Lu: How does one make that recursively? 
Jennifer Luo: Thatâs what im thinking Itâs similar to the triangle tho I would think 
Michael Lu: Like How would you draw that 
Jennifer Luo: Oh I mean Wdym 
Michael Lu: What is the unit In serps triangle, the unit is a triangle with a triangular hole In serps carpet, the unit is a square with a square hole 
Jennifer Luo: Itâs a pentagon With a pentagon hole Oh Itâs cuz he pic is tilted Iâll make it straight 
Michael Lu: Idgi 
Jennifer Luo: So yeah? 
Michael Lu: So like what do u draw first 
Jennifer Luo: A pentagon with a pentagon hole?? The pentagon?? I havenât even looked at the code yet man I literally just looked at the only Photo Iâd say the big pentagon tho??? Iâll just do it and give you the code when Iâm done Do you want me to animate it? Like how you did 
Michael Lu: Umm here are the guidelines for animations You create a fractal class I mean, you create a class of that fractal like Hexaflake 
Jennifer Luo: Wait Am I doing the hexaflake or the pentaflake 
Michael Lu: Then the it has a class of components which are the units Idk whatever it is 
Jennifer Luo: Okay 
Michael Lu: The units are generated recursively So if u could follow that structure, thatâd be great 
Jennifer Luo: Uh okay Iâll try Did you make it in Js also Just wondering 
Michael Lu: Is all in JS, thatâs me first language 
Jennifer Luo: Right okay Wait yooo is Andy dating Florence Nvm
I have confirmation 
Michael Lu: I donât think he is. 
Jennifer Luo: What Huh thatâs surprising 
Michael Lu: Ha 
Jennifer Luo: Wait also I think Iâll do the leaf one too I mean I started that one already So Iâll do both 
Michael Lu: Cool Dammmmm U made that? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah Iâm working on fixing it up So itâll zoom in and stuff 
Michael Lu: Dam thatâs cooool Java or JavaScript? 
Jennifer Luo: Also I lowkey still donât get the animation thing tho for the pentagon Js 
Michael Lu: Have u learned JavaScript now? 
Jennifer Luo: No LOLOL I basically just tell my dad what to do and he types what I say in js as I watch 
Michael Lu: Oh I see Welp send me the codes when ur done â Looks pretty good ð 
Jennifer Luo: He like complains about how I do it Iâm not so good ways and yet refuses to fix it Mkay

Michael Lu: Yo Quiero taCODE bell (The fractal code) 
Jennifer Luo: Uhhh later Alsooo Itâs not like you had to specify lolol I wasnât gonna send you my bot code 
Michael Lu: I specified to get a response earlier Lol 
Jennifer Luo: Ahhh sorry Iâll send it now 
Michael Lu: No point do it tmrw 
Jennifer Luo: Also For the pentagon one I still donât get how you did it So I didnât animate it and added a zoom feature 
Michael Lu: I didnât do it lol 
Jennifer Luo: ?? No lole Like I still donât get how you did the animations I made the pentagon And added zoom in features for all tbeee 
Michael Lu: Does it display? 
Jennifer Luo: Three Yeah I just donât get the component and stuff 
Michael Lu: JavaScript right? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah 
Michael Lu: Whatâs the zoom feature 
Jennifer Luo: Here hold on Iâll show you 
Michael Lu: Holy shit Sherlock Lol 
Jennifer Luo: Thatâs basically why it took so fucking long to make them 
Michael Lu: Send me the code tmrw 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah okay Also Ethanâs ppt is like 21 slides long He says if we want we can speed through that and show the fractals and kinda explain the algorithm if we want 
Michael Lu: Why Also why have I not seen it 
Jennifer Luo: I saw him at sb today He says heâs gonna put it onto drive Idk when 
Michael Lu: Why is t 21 slides? 
Jennifer Luo: Idk I didnât finish looking through But like We have to present for 20 min.... 
Michael Lu: Whatevs weâll discuss tmrw in math I guess 
Jennifer Luo: Mhm Hopefully heâll give us time idk Isnât tomorrow like cut day?? 
Michael Lu: Maybe 
Jennifer Luo: Isnât that why we arenât presenting tomorrow?? Whatever Well just do it in class LMFAOOO *lmao

Jennifer Luo: Yeah If itâs not two spaces in front of a bullet Are you trying to make your bot dodge lol 
Michael Lu: So does the player die? 
Jennifer Luo: What is that dotted mess

Jennifer Luo: Yo do you know if the robotics class is hard I canât take stat anymore cuz of schedule conflicts and now I have an empty period 
Michael Lu: Robotics is anything but hard lol All tech classes are a joke 
Jennifer Luo: Oh So like would it be a bad idea to take it 
Michael Lu: No itâs still a good class Itâs a different experience; thatâs what gives tech classes their value. Donât expect the academic rigor of a physics + math + engineering class, however. Itâs a different dynamic. 
Jennifer Luo: Ahhh I see I see Thanksss 
Michael Lu: Yo Lemme hand in ur precalc textbook too 
Jennifer Luo: No stahp Iâll bring it myself lol

Michael Lu: XD 
Jennifer Luo: wait I thought this year was a building Not a library 
Michael Lu: Idk man whatever it was 
Jennifer Luo: LOL 
Michael Lu: Nah man being. Senior sucks 
Jennifer Luo: Being a first semester senior sucks Hold up nah Senior year is gonna suck Ducking George Wang on our physics 2 ughhh 
Michael Lu: O Youâve handled worse right 
Jennifer Luo: ?? 
Michael Lu: Is Gwang the lowest form of human being you have ever encountered? 
Jennifer Luo: I guess Yeah There are people lower??? 
Michael Lu: Lol yeah

Michael Lu: Wat 
Jennifer Luo: Like How humans use computers? Anyways my project is about fat finger problem lolol 
Michael Lu: Whatâs that 
Jennifer Luo: Like basically If thereâs a small item And you wanna click it But your finger is too fat 
Michael Lu: Oh 
Jennifer Luo: And misses lol

Conversation:
Michael Lu: Which webassign u do 
Jennifer Luo: ??? For c? 
Michael Lu: Anyone 
Jennifer Luo: Uh did 2 And started the vector I wanna try finishing the 3 c tonight Was working so I couldnât do them ;( 
Michael Lu: Aight aight ð 
Jennifer Luo: Wait Why 
Michael Lu: Was going to ask abt webassign 
Jennifer Luo: Oh lol We get it youâre good 
Michael Lu: Ok 
Jennifer Luo: Nvm I didnât realize that these 3 webassign werenât review Iâm not even going to try Did you do the flux questions from the vector webassign tho 
Michael Lu: The parallelogram? The text was TLDR asked will Turns out 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah I realized after I read it 
Michael Lu: Answer is all the same 
Jennifer Luo: No the blocks Wut But what are the formulas?? 
Michael Lu: You have part a b c? 
Jennifer Luo: Cuz in the longass text they never actually tell you how to calculate Yeah 
Michael Lu: It gives you a value of X kg/s 
Jennifer Luo: Different shaped blocks Yeah 
Michael Lu: I guessed X kg/s for part A Because intuition I guess Turns out x kg/s is the answer for b and c 
Jennifer Luo: Why What So you just guessed?? 
Michael Lu: In retrospect it makes sense I guess Hold on 
Jennifer Luo: Why Yeah I just tried t and it works... 
Michael Lu: So flux depends on vertical surface area 
Jennifer Luo: Wth mindblown Yeah Oh itâs the same Wait no?? Itâs not the same?? 
Michael Lu: The gray areas are not the same 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah 
Michael Lu: But take the vertical component (perpendicular to flow) Is still l^2 
Jennifer Luo: Ohhhh because it only cared about vertical 
Michael Lu: I think that was wills logic 
Jennifer Luo: What is I^2?? Rorarion? Oh Ooohhhh makes sense Wait then how did you do the last question With the radial shit 
Michael Lu: Cylinder 
Jennifer Luo: Wut 
Michael Lu: Idk I thought sphere but itâs cylinder 
Jennifer Luo: I thought sphere Oh 
Michael Lu: Thatâs a string 
Jennifer Luo: Thatâs a strong??? Strong Strong String 
Michael Lu: Now it sound waves 
Jennifer Luo: Ohhhhhhhhh 
Michael Lu: Center line of cylinder is string Radius increases as sound propagates I suppose 
Jennifer Luo: So like Do we just find the volume of the cylinder?? 
Michael Lu: For B? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah 
Michael Lu: Itâs area 
Jennifer Luo: Wut 
Michael Lu: Sound travels along the radii The lateral surface of the sphere is perpendicular to the radius Just how the radius is perpendicular to the rim of a circle (kind of) 
Jennifer Luo: So then like A plane going through the string? 
Michael Lu: A plane âï¸ going through the sound 
Jennifer Luo: Tf You know what Fuck it Imma just wait till we learn it Thanks thoooo 
Michael Lu: Ummm lemme try one more time :) Thatâs a front view ok 
Jennifer Luo: Wait front as in like We looking through the string right 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Jennifer Luo: Okay 
Michael Lu: Thatâs how sound will travel 
Jennifer Luo: Okey 
Michael Lu: Draw a radius Thatâs âperpendicularâ to the edge The rim of the circle 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah 
Michael Lu: So if sound travels along the radius direction It cuts through the circle right, In a perpendicular fashion 
Jennifer Luo: Yes 
Michael Lu: Now extend the circle to a cylinder The edge becomes a curved surface right? 
Jennifer Luo: OHHHHH 
Michael Lu: Yuh the lateral surface of the cylinder 
Jennifer Luo: so itâs like A plane cutting through half a cylinder 
Michael Lu: More like radii or sound cutting through the lateral surface of a cylinder? I guess Idk I think you have the right idea 
Jennifer Luo: Okay I think I got it Yayyy Thank youuuuuu 
Michael Lu: Thatâs what I got 
Jennifer Luo: Um okay nvm 
Michael Lu: So idk hopefully it helps solidify 
Jennifer Luo: I didnât get it Why is there pi involved... Isnât it just a rectangle 
Michael Lu: U know lateral surface If a cylinder Itâs the surface area without the circles 
Jennifer Luo: Oh Okay thatâs not what I thought it was But it makes sense Okey Yeah I think I get it nkw Now Hahaha Iâm dumb 
Michael Lu: K cool beans ð¥ð¥ 
Jennifer Luo: Thank youuu!!! 


Conversation:
Jennifer Luo: Yo did you do the lane yet *lab 
Michael Lu: Yeah âDid itâ 
Jennifer Luo: Did you do the last question 
Michael Lu: Seems very not legit 
Jennifer Luo: With the other experiment Lmfao 
Michael Lu: Ummm ya hold on lemme pull it ur Up Whatâs up 
Jennifer Luo: So uh 
Michael Lu: Did u libraries Linearize 
Jennifer Luo: Did you graph rho on y and 1/v on x Yeah 
Michael Lu: I get like 0.1 kg 
Jennifer Luo: Okay same but like Uh how do you explain why theyâre all similar masses?? They look like they fit the line?? 
Michael Lu: U have to explain? 
Jennifer Luo: Oh I thought we did... Oh it doesnât say to explain 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Jennifer Luo: I guess we donât then? 
Michael Lu: Of course of course 
Jennifer Luo: I mean remember last year somebody didnât explain and they got points off lmfao 
Michael Lu: Lol yeah that was me 
Jennifer Luo: Oh yeahhhhhh hahaha Okey Iâll risk it lmao Thankssss 
Michael Lu: Wait what was ur desbsity for the hitdog 
Jennifer Luo: 0.984 Ours floated 
Michael Lu: Lol 0.86 idk 
Jennifer Luo: Wait wut 
Michael Lu: Is it supposed to float? 
Jennifer Luo: Why didnât it float then Yeah?? Idk The density is less than water... 
Michael Lu: Lol I got 1.12 for the first experimebt Then a nice drop down to 0.86 
Jennifer Luo: Wtf the first one makes sense haha 
Michael Lu: sCiENcE 
Jennifer Luo: Wait first experiment as in like the whole hotdog? 
Michael Lu: Yes Lol

Conversation:
Jennifer Luo: Littyyyy Can you help me with a question :(( 
Michael Lu: Idk didnât get up to it 
Jennifer Luo: Ohhhhh my b sorry Itâs hard ;( 
Michael Lu: Howâd u do 9 
Jennifer Luo: And not online just letting you know Oh uh lemme look Wait did you try it and get a wrong answer 
Michael Lu: I didnât do anything yet 
Jennifer Luo: Oh okay so 
Michael Lu: Is this supposed to be intuitive 
Jennifer Luo: Basically where the dotted line goes to both sides, the pressure is the same Nope But like there was a hint for the one above and I just applied the same concept idk 
Michael Lu: pgh = pgh? 
Jennifer Luo: Kinda Itâs P=P Cuz there are weights Instead of liquids Also uh Use the gauge pressure Idfk why but yeah 
Michael Lu: Yeah got it U need #10? 
Jennifer Luo: Yah 
Michael Lu: Itâs the same thing as #9, think of the bottle as that hydraulic shit 
Jennifer Luo: Wut 
Michael Lu: P = P 
Jennifer Luo: I think I did that P=F/A right And solve for the F? 
Michael Lu: Whatâs the force given 
Jennifer Luo: 120 Wait did you get it already? 
Michael Lu: Lol I got what u got 5578.51 
Jennifer Luo: Wtf Why it be wrong ;(( Ughhhh Maybe Iâll ask wells tomorrow Why tf doesnât this work ;(( 
Michael Lu: Was that your first guess 
Jennifer Luo: No I flipped the denominators by accident And got 2.581 The first time And then that was my second and itâs wrong And I just tried rounding it and itâs wrong too WEBASSIGN IS RIGGEDDDDSSD ;(( 
Michael Lu: Dam 
Jennifer Luo: Hahahaha thanks for the help tho Imma just go ask wells then haha 
Michael Lu: Ur webass Is demented 
Jennifer Luo: Lmfao yeah 
Michael Lu: The method worked of Jeffâs

Michael Lu: Whatâs on both physics quizzes tmrw Buoyancy not included? And is C just kinematics and vectors Or includes projectile 
Jennifer Luo: 2 is just on the second webassign I think so no buoyancy And I thought c was just on vectors.... Oh wait Yeah I think kinematics too Shouldnât be any projectiles Nvm no kinematic either Just vectors I asked jen Wait is hydraulics on the quiz?? Cuz some was on the webassign but like itâs on a separate quiz from last year 
Michael Lu: Last year they were slower I guess Iâm pretty sure itâs on the quiz. 
Jennifer Luo: Ohhh okey ic

Michael Lu: XD np Share number when done thx. ! 
Jennifer Luo: Yah But um I think theyâll be diff cuz I use more decimals than you 
Michael Lu: K :o 
Jennifer Luo: I got 8.102 for R.... A lil off 
Michael Lu: Lol Help 
Jennifer Luo: ???? Tf lmao Hold up why is your slope so small My slope is 3.430 
Michael Lu: Ohhhhh I looked at R^2 Oop 
Jennifer Luo: LMAO Oh wait You didnât do +b? 
Michael Lu: Y 
Jennifer Luo: Idk I did

Conversation:
Jennifer Luo: Are you still stuck on 27 
Michael Lu: Umm Yes 
Jennifer Luo: Ohhhh you can search up how to find interaction of planes But like thereâs some stuff going on that I donât get why lmao 
Michael Lu: So what I rlly did Was did half the problem on my own Then use the answer given in the answer key to âdoâ the rest How far did u get into hw I just got home 
Jennifer Luo: -.- I finished 
Michael Lu: How do 40 & 27 
Jennifer Luo: Okay so 27 Thereâs lowkey black magic happening 
Michael Lu: Did u cross production 
Jennifer Luo: So basically this is how you solve for the intersection of two planes No Wait Yeah I did cross product Wait how far into the question did you get 
Michael Lu: Solved the intersection vector 
Jennifer Luo: Ohhhh okay 
Michael Lu: How get second vector Perpendicular thru point? 
Jennifer Luo: I just did the point on the line to the point given Since that vector has to be Copland right 
Michael Lu: What point in the line 
Jennifer Luo: *coplanar Like you know The equation of a line gives a direction vector and a point That point 
Michael Lu: How to find the direction vector thru given point 
Jennifer Luo: Wut Wait how did you do the beginning of the question? You found a line?? Or a vector 
Michael Lu: Vector 
Jennifer Luo: Oh I got a line Thatâs why Um 
Michael Lu: Whatâs the point For that line 
Jennifer Luo: 5/6, 4/3, 0 
Michael Lu: How find 
Jennifer Luo: Oh my b sorry 
Michael Lu: Set z 0 0 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah Thatâs black magic man But yeah Wait no What no Set it equal to t And solve for the parametric equations of the line 
Michael Lu: It? What it :( 
Jennifer Luo: Z 
Michael Lu: Z=t? 
Jennifer Luo: Basically set z to t and solve for x and y Yeah 
Michael Lu: What abt x and y 
Jennifer Luo: You solve for it Now you have 2 equations and 2 âunknownsâ Solve in terms of t 
Michael Lu: Holy shit 
Jennifer Luo: And then you get parametric Yeah 
Michael Lu: How du figure out 
Jennifer Luo: I searched up how to find the intersection of two planes 
Michael Lu: Is blacc magicc 
Jennifer Luo: And this stuff came up Yeah 
Michael Lu: As much as I am interested in ur method And appreciate ur skill and hard work I only have two lines to do 27 
Jennifer Luo: Lmfao wth 
Michael Lu: So I donât think I can fit everything 
Jennifer Luo: You used both sides already??? LMFAO 
Michael Lu: Lol gonna have to pass sry XD How do 40 
Jennifer Luo: Get two vectors So like A to b and a to c Cross them Then plug into formula with a point 
Michael Lu: Oh I get it Jk I have no fucking idea 
Jennifer Luo: Lmao okay sorry So 
Michael Lu: Lol wut XD 
Jennifer Luo: Two vectors 
Michael Lu: Am not at peak brain performance rn 
Jennifer Luo: I did x to y intercept and x to z intercept And theyâre on the plane right So if you cross them You get the normal vector Now just pick an intercept And plug into the formula for a plane 
Michael Lu: Is that how to start? 
Jennifer Luo: Yah 
Michael Lu: Much thx What abt 43 
Jennifer Luo: Np 
Michael Lu: Wait 41 
Jennifer Luo: Um hold on I need to get the textbook out haha Oh thanks So 
Michael Lu: Is the blacc magicc ? 
Jennifer Luo: You just do the z=t thing Yeah but The textbook answer sets z=-7t If you wanna compare with book Wut 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Jennifer Luo: Wait did you get it lmao 
Michael Lu: Textbook answer 
Jennifer Luo: But that was me tho I was like wtf is this 
Michael Lu: lol idk 
Jennifer Luo: Wait you got it tho right 
Michael Lu: Oui oui bien sÃ»r 
Jennifer Luo: Oui oui Wait when youâre done can I ask for physics help :(( 
Michael Lu: Witch physics 
Jennifer Luo: 2 lab 
Michael Lu: C 
Jennifer Luo: Okey thankssss 
Michael Lu: (Si) 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah I got it.... Lmao 
Michael Lu: Wat halp ned 
Jennifer Luo: So for the last part Does the gas do the same work?? Since a is 0?? 
Michael Lu: Last of last ? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah sorry 
Michael Lu: Oh wait 
Jennifer Luo: But isnât it moving at a constant speed? 
Michael Lu: Good point Yes u right 
Jennifer Luo: Ohh okay Lmao okey thank youu 
Michael Lu: Thx for help math!!!!!!!!!! 
Jennifer Luo: Np Not like I returned all the webassign help rip 
Michael Lu: Wait idk part c Help :/ 
Jennifer Luo: For the lab? I just said itâs the same Because fnet is 0 So force from gas equals force from books But force from books didnât change So force from gas didnât change And d is ame Same So same work 
Michael Lu: R u sure 
Jennifer Luo: No.... 
Michael Lu: Lol ok Iâll trust u 
Jennifer Luo: Thatâs why I came to ask you LMAO LOL 
Michael Lu: Ur sound more legit 
Jennifer Luo: Lol okay Also isnât the same concept as like Lowering and lifting a box Idk 
Michael Lu: Idk seems legit tho 
Jennifer Luo: Okay then lmao Wait for the first graph is your regression a quadratic? 
Michael Lu: Inverse? 
Jennifer Luo: Wut Oh Wait what OH so like 1/V? 
Michael Lu: C 
Jennifer Luo: With a b value right? 
Michael Lu: Lol no Idk

Michael Lu: Sigma 
Jennifer Luo: Itâs on the sheet he gave us Ohhhh My bad sorry I thought you meant one 
Michael Lu: What ur numbers 
Jennifer Luo: For what question 
Michael Lu: 11 
Jennifer Luo: Your answer should be really close to the graphical answer The graph is pretty to scale 
Michael Lu: Idgi canât get ur graph with ur numbers 
Jennifer Luo: Wut My answer for b was 1.033 
Michael Lu: kq1/x + kq2/(1+ 1.5)? 
Jennifer Luo: Uh Why 1 + 1.5 
Michael Lu: X+1.5 
Jennifer Luo: Should be minus 
Michael Lu: X-1.5 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah 
Michael Lu: Is q2 our put as negative 
Jennifer Luo: Wut Out put? Q2 is neg and q1 is pos 
Michael Lu: Talking abt pRt A I got b 
Jennifer Luo: Ohhhhhh Wait why donât the numbers work?? Like if you have a point super close to q1 
Michael Lu: Idj how u choose ur graph 
Jennifer Luo: The v will be really positive So the v is positive going to infinity When you have it super close to q1, itâs super negative so itâll be negative going to infinity 
Michael Lu: Ohhhh Like the dipole graph He showers is Showed 
Jennifer Luo: Idk I didnât really get the dipole graphs lol 
Michael Lu: Ol got it thxxxxxxxxx! 
Jennifer Luo: Npnp 


Conversation:
Jennifer Luo: Do you think the short answers on tomorrowâs test will be more like ap questions or webassign questions? For c 
Michael Lu: The former He said 
Jennifer Luo: Fuck Okay thanks 
Michael Lu: Wait what AP easier 
Jennifer Luo: Are they tho?? 
Michael Lu: They donât have extremely wacky calculus 
Jennifer Luo: The ones we did in class were hard ;( Yeah but theyâre multiple parts 
Michael Lu: I believe Well theyâre hard But not as hard as the notes questions 
Jennifer Luo: Notes? 
Michael Lu: Like the e field on a ring ding spring around a point 
Jennifer Luo: Wtf I donât remember that question lmao Okay maybe the ap questions are easier Rip 
Michael Lu: Example Find the e field at point A given that shit is charged AP questions are simpler shapes 
Jennifer Luo: Hmmmmm Okay makes sense haha Do you think thereâll be a curve 
Michael Lu: I hope :) 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Good shit Amen ð 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: #2 help thank you 
Jennifer Luo: Negative And you should be good Because delta V is pos and q is neg 
Michael Lu: Still wrong 
Jennifer Luo: ??? Hold on 
Michael Lu: Also is 11 multiple choice no 
Jennifer Luo: 11 is no Wait uh Did you miss the e? In your answer 
Michael Lu: Lol good point XD 
Jennifer Luo: Did it work 
Michael Lu: Thx Lol I feel stupiz 
Jennifer Luo: Did you try -100? Lemme check 
Michael Lu: Tried 100v 
Jennifer Luo: Yah -100 ev 
Michael Lu: Yay thx IOU 
Jennifer Luo: Npnp 


Conversation:
Jennifer Luo: Is there a c quiz tomorrow???? 
Michael Lu: Lol yeah 
Jennifer Luo: Is it just like circuit review? Or does it also have rc 
Michael Lu: The former I believe 
Jennifer Luo: Okey thanks Is the 2 quiz on just potential? Or also fields 
Michael Lu: Primarily the latter with a touch of the former. I believe. 
Jennifer Luo: Okey thankssss

Jennifer Luo: Itâs much better than my nonexistent lab lol 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: When u did the lab Discharge u graphed only from 0 to 240? 
Jennifer Luo: I think? Cuz we donât have the rest of the data 
Michael Lu: U didnât fudge at all? 
Jennifer Luo: ? I did the graph a while ago hold on lemme pull it up This be my graph Are the numbers bad? 
Michael Lu: Idk Iâll work on it Wait Isnât it current vs time And voltage vs time 
Jennifer Luo: Fml yeah Youâre right Fuck 
Michael Lu: Dear Jennifer Luo, Best wishes, 
John Green 
Jennifer Luo: Wut lol Wait did you mess with the data again lol We have diff regression equations for charging Wait Why is my exponent thing off by a factor of 10... Nvm Okey many thanks mr. John green 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Sir 
Jennifer Luo: Sir 
Michael Lu: All I want for Christmassssss Is 
Jennifer Luo: Lab? Lol 
Michael Lu: For you to send me the lab data. I was sick today. Exatclyyyyy 
Jennifer Luo: âSick?â 
Michael Lu: Quite Quite sick I just woke up

Conversation:
Jennifer Luo: Is this physics 2?? 
Michael Lu: Cir Ya 
Jennifer Luo: I didnât do any webassign a Webassigns Hold on 
Michael Lu: Iâm betting on 4 lol Idek 
Jennifer Luo: Wait wuttttttttt I thought itâs whether 1 or 2 I think itâs 2? Lemme try Okay wait Iâm dumb Itâs not 1 or 2 Iâm so dumb Itâs probably 4 Fuck Can we ask somebody else 
Michael Lu: K hold on 
Jennifer Luo: Lol 
Michael Lu: Yup Iâm on it 
Jennifer Luo: Wait you tried 3? Imma just got for it lolol 4 Yeah Itâs 4 
Michael Lu: Thx! 
Jennifer Luo: Help 
Michael Lu: 1/2 m v squared X1.05 Convert to Power 
Jennifer Luo: And then divide by V right Thatâs what I did tho... 
Michael Lu: Convert to power With 60 sec 
Jennifer Luo: Wait so multiply by 60?? 
Michael Lu: Divide 
Jennifer Luo: Oh Wut Why divide 
Michael Lu: P = W/t 
Jennifer Luo: Ohhhhh okay icic I got it Muchos gracias 
Michael Lu: C senator 


Conversation:
Jennifer Luo: Show me the full question for the first one Because Apparantly theyâre diff 
Michael Lu: Do the mult choice first? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah 
Michael Lu: I might break my hand Lol 
Jennifer Luo: Wut For the right hand rule? Just send a photo lol Noooooooo I need the full question Iâm pretty sure itâs canât exist Hold on Because they have to be perpendicular and theyâre not 
Michael Lu: Hmmmm 
Jennifer Luo: I think everybody has like diff directions 
Michael Lu: But is answer always the same? 
Jennifer Luo: Cuz yan said Annie had a similar one but he had a diff one that worked Nope Yam has a case where there was an answer I think it was because his things were perpendicular 
Michael Lu: Mine are not perpendicular tho Like urs 
Jennifer Luo: So then it should be canât exist 
Michael Lu: Shit itâs wrong 
Jennifer Luo: Wait what Iâm sorry Iâm so sorry 
Michael Lu: Jk 
Jennifer Luo: OH BRO I WAS SCARED 
Michael Lu: Thx Jen ! 
Jennifer Luo: ;( np 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Jennifer Luo: Oh yeah oops Uh so First off you know the angle right Phi 
Michael Lu: qbvsin 
Jennifer Luo: Wut 
Michael Lu: Lol then? 
Jennifer Luo: Hold on lemme pull up my webass Okay so If it goes in at an angle of theta And it moves in a circular motion It has to leave at the same angle 
Michael Lu: Lol what Circular 
Jennifer Luo: When it goes into the magnetic field it moves in a circular motion 
Michael Lu: ð¤ð¤ð¤ð I guess so Lol idk 
Jennifer Luo: Wait were you not here in class?? Oh lol Do you want notes? 
Michael Lu: Theyâre online 
Jennifer Luo: Oh wait yeah So you got the angle right 
Michael Lu: Phi = theta? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah 
Michael Lu: Yes chief 
Jennifer Luo: Okey And um velocity is a bit of a bitch So You can find f right And this is circular motion 
Michael Lu: oh 
Jennifer Luo: So F=(mv^2/r) 
Michael Lu: = mv^2/r 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah 
Michael Lu: Qvbsin 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah Oh wait no Just qvb Because itâs sin90 
Michael Lu: R = d/2? 
Jennifer Luo: Um Whatâs your angle 
Michael Lu: Qvb = mv^2/r 
Jennifer Luo: Wait whereâd you get d/2 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Jennifer Luo: Did you assume it moves in a semicircle 
Michael Lu: Good poiinnt 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah finding r is annoying Geometry is required A bit of a messy drawing The point is the center of the circle btw 
Michael Lu: Yay Smart person 
Jennifer Luo: âSmartâ You got it? Yayyyy

Jennifer Luo: Hm okay 


Conversation:
Jennifer Luo: Is it a test or quiz for 2? Cuz it spans like 2 quizzes from last year 
Michael Lu: âQuizâ I belive Syllabus calls it a âquizâ 
Jennifer Luo: Wait is double battery and terminal stuff on it? 
Michael Lu: Yes 
Jennifer Luo: okay Thankssss 
Michael Lu: Np 


Conversation:
Jennifer Luo: Mein math hw obtained 
Michael Lu: Okay Olah* How does wire resistance not be error in battery internal resistance Am not understand Also #5 of lab qot qot qot!??? 
Jennifer Luo: Oh shit lol I was gonna ask you for 5 But I thought it was no? Tbh im still thinking on 5.... But I said that the resistances of the wires are so tiny that their effect is pretty negligible Idk he said something like that in class once I think no?? For 5 Because during the experiment voltage drains from the battery So like Vt=E-Ir So the E value we measured in the beginning isnât totally accurate throughout the experiment Which effects r?? I think??? Idk :(( 
Michael Lu: 5 Iâm thinking no bc theyâre not identical lol idk Lollllll urs sounds good too 
Jennifer Luo: Oh youâre saying cuz like the internal resistances arenât the same because the batteries arenât identical? So like it isnât possible for them to be EXACTLY the same? 
Michael Lu: lol itâs petty But Iâm out of ideas hide Chief 
Jennifer Luo: Lol okay Wait does my explanation work tho? 
Michael Lu: Yes 
Jennifer Luo: Okey Many thanks 
Michael Lu: No thank u I thank you more 
Jennifer Luo: I thank you most?? 
Michael Lu: Idk about that chief Lol XD 
Jennifer Luo: Uh for number 4 is it increases terminal voltage?? 
Michael Lu: Wouldnât the slope be more negative So lower terminal voltage caps Qot qe qot 
Jennifer Luo: But doesnât I change as well 
Michael Lu: Oh lol Does it? 
Jennifer Luo: Wouldnât it?? Lol idk 
Michael Lu: Good point How would it change 
Jennifer Luo: I said increase because if I decreases then the resistors get less voltage so combined less terminal voltage? Oh wait I guess I mean less terminal voltage then Not increase 
Michael Lu: Keeeeenwahhhh 
Jennifer Luo: Wuuuuuuut 
Michael Lu: So less terminal voltage 
Jennifer Luo: I think?? Idk does the explanation sound right 
Michael Lu: Sounds good to me chief 
Jennifer Luo: Aight SOS 2 is wrong The resistance of the wires donât matter because in the lab weâre only looking at the changes in I and V So the real values of R total doesnât matter 
Michael Lu: What #2? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah 
Michael Lu: Resistance doesnât affect internal resistance? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah 
Michael Lu: Ik 
Jennifer Luo: Wait yeah But the explanation part Itâs not that itâs negligible 
Michael Lu: Lol oh I thought u were explaining five my friend 
Jennifer Luo: Oh wuuuuuut 
Michael Lu: Lel Dwthen

Jennifer Luo: Help Help please 
Michael Lu: ð hi 
Jennifer Luo: Halo Help Please Helpppp I'm stupid and I completely forgot how to do derivatives Please help 
Michael Lu: :(( which ones 
Jennifer Luo: Helpppppppoo 2b For the homework Im stupid and I forgot :(((((((( 
Michael Lu: You don't have to differentiate for that one just factor 
Jennifer Luo: Oh 
Michael Lu: Oh wait you do 
Jennifer Luo: You found the derivative of the factored version? 
Michael Lu: You can do it both ways 
Jennifer Luo: Oh But I still forgot how to do derivatives 
Michael Lu: No you differentiate the standard for 
Jennifer Luo: Plz help 
Michael Lu: Form* 
Jennifer Luo: I forgot what differentiate mean too .... The last time I did derivatives was before summer :((((( ;-; 
Michael Lu: Differentiate = Take the derivative of something 
Jennifer Luo: Oh Wow But me is confused 
Michael Lu: So for a polynomial term: such as 3x^2 You take the exponent - 2 and multiply it by the coefficient And then decrease the exponent by one 
Jennifer Luo: But 
Michael Lu: (d/dx) (3x^2) = 6x 
Jennifer Luo: What about the 


(f(x + a) - f(a))/a Equation 
Michael Lu: Oh that is the definition of a derivative 
Jennifer Luo: Tf ;-( 
Michael Lu: Nobody ever uses that unless it's for a proof 
Jennifer Luo: So what's the derivative of x^2 - 1 
Michael Lu: 2x 
Jennifer Luo: Why 
Michael Lu: You take the derivative of each individual term x^2, multiply coefficient by 2, and decrease exponent by one = 2x 
Jennifer Luo: Oh and then -1 is 0 
Michael Lu: -1x^0, multiply by 0 Yah 
Jennifer Luo: Wait Sonlike Is that how you do derivatives for everything??? 
Michael Lu: So constants always reduce to 0 upon differentiation 
Jennifer Luo: I did not look this far in 
Michael Lu: Aight lemme talk to you at lunch to explain more stuffs 
Jennifer Luo: :((( thank you <3 
Michael Lu: â¤ï¸ If you need help just msg me

Jennifer Luo: Do you not bring your phone with you??? 
Michael Lu: Nope 
Jennifer Luo: Oh Oops 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Jennifer Luo: How do you prove that a series converges Helppppp 
Michael Lu: Infinite series formula? 
Jennifer Luo: What 
Michael Lu: Is it geometric? 
Jennifer Luo: No? Oh yeah it's the infinite series formula 
Michael Lu: Lol okee 
Jennifer Luo: How do I do ittttt 
Michael Lu: Errr, plug in the first term and common ratio into a1/(1 - r) Is there a specific problem you're referring to? 
Jennifer Luo: Uh yeah Oh shit It's the partial sum Not the infinite sum oops 
Michael Lu: :/ 
Jennifer Luo: 1b on page 649 Sorry :(( 
Michael Lu: Idk I think a1 = 1/4 r = 2 
Jennifer Luo: Mhm 
Michael Lu: So plug into partial sum formula? 
Jennifer Luo: Mhm That's what I did? And I got the limit was infinity But like How do you know it doesn't converge? 
Michael Lu: Limit l? 
Jennifer Luo: ?? 
Michael Lu: Wat limit I'm confused :(( 
Jennifer Luo: The limit of the partial sum Doesn't it say that in the directions?? 
Michael Lu: Is this to test convergence? 
Jennifer Luo: Um Idk I'm clueless 
Michael Lu: Saem tho 
Jennifer Luo: Fuckkkk Sighssssss 
Michael Lu: If you plug in n is infinity into partial sum formula don't you get infinity So the series diverges? 
Jennifer Luo: ?? When does a series diverge?? 
Michael Lu: When the series doesn't equate to a value 
Jennifer Luo: Ohhhhhh So as long as it goes to a value it converges?? 
Michael Lu: Yah 
Jennifer Luo: So if it goes to positive or negative unintuitive *infinity It's divergent? 
Michael Lu: Ya 
Jennifer Luo: Ohhhh okeyy Thanksss Are you gonna study tomorrow before the test? 
Michael Lu: lol probably 
Jennifer Luo: lol I'm gonna study in the morning and lunch Im so screwed ;(( 
Michael Lu: Lol k saem Squeeze theorem makes me nervous :(( 
Jennifer Luo: SMAE THO arghhh TBH if you feel nervous everybody should 
Michael Lu: Tfw Dickson creates the test the night before :(( 
Jennifer Luo: :((( Can't even ask questions about the test 
Michael Lu: Do you bring the textbook to school? 
Jennifer Luo: No But I'm gonna bring it tomorrow So I can do questions 
Michael Lu: HMU fam 
Jennifer Luo: I gotchu Just find me 
Michael Lu: How's ur studying? So dead rn 
Jennifer Luo: Smae Looking at the L'Ã´pital's proof like wtffff 
Michael Lu: Lel I asked him to reprocess it but he was like "nah" 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah Sighssss And everybody else was like nahhh 
Michael Lu: There's a detailed version in the textbook tho 
Jennifer Luo: Oh really? 
Michael Lu: Yah in the lhopitals chapter 
Jennifer Luo: Oh mkay 
Michael Lu: Welp so dead right now :((( Gnight good luck tmrw You'll do fine :) 
Jennifer Luo: :(( thanks Good luck :))) Night~ 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Can u help me with physics? 
Jennifer Luo: What's up 
Michael Lu: When one object is dropped and another is thrown down Which one has the greater change in velocity? 
Jennifer Luo: The one dropped 
Michael Lu: Y 
Jennifer Luo: Cuz like since it starts at 0 velocity, it spends more time in the air before it hits the ground So it accelerates more 
Michael Lu: K Seems legit Thx :)) 
Jennifer Luo: Lmao Np~ I didn't see you or Ethan or Brian... 
Michael Lu: I thought ur at Ko 
Jennifer Luo: Uh It didn't work out Where are you it's Guys

Jennifer Luo: Thanks ;-; Have fun :(( I'm going to the orthodontist :(( 
Michael Lu: :PP 
Jennifer Luo: Helppp 
Michael Lu: Olah 
Jennifer Luo: You did the math homework right The monotone sequence one 
Michael Lu: Ya 
Jennifer Luo: How did you do 12 Wait I mean 16 
Michael Lu: Differentiate it 
Jennifer Luo: I know but I got it But I can't tell if it's greater than 0 or not 
Michael Lu: There's a coefficient of -2 right? 
Jennifer Luo: Uh What 
Michael Lu: Did u get -2ne^-2n 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah But there's also a e^-2n Right 
Michael Lu: Errr what's your equation for the derivative of ne^-2n? 
Jennifer Luo: I got 

e^2n - 2ne^-2n Wait I meant e^-2n Am I wrong... 
Michael Lu: Did u chain rule? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah? 
Michael Lu: What did u get? e^-2n? 
Jennifer Luo: Um No 
Michael Lu: Okay what did you get? 
Jennifer Luo: I got 

e^-2n - 2ne^-2n Two terms?? 
Michael Lu: ? 
Jennifer Luo: ? Argh Can I call you Typing is too complicated 
Michael Lu: Sure Cool beans man 
Jennifer Luo: Thank you~ 
Michael Lu: Lol gotta resubmit my hw XD

Conversation:
Jennifer Luo: Hello~ I need help again :(( 
Michael Lu: Hi sry I'm late 
Jennifer Luo: Did you do the lab Nah you're not late 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Jennifer Luo: Thanks for helping :)) So for part 2 Which equation did you libraries *linearize 
Michael Lu: d = (1/2) * g * t^2 
Jennifer Luo: What Did we learn that in class???? 
Michael Lu: ? 
Jennifer Luo: ? Is that the linearized formula? 
Michael Lu: It's the same equation just vi = 0 
Jennifer Luo: What 
Michael Lu: d = 0.5 * a * t^2 + vi * t 
Jennifer Luo: Oh did you use

vf = vi + 2at? Wait 2ad Wait No I'm wrong 
Michael Lu: a = g, vi = 0 
Jennifer Luo: Ohhh okay So then You graphed d on y And t^2 on x? 
Michael Lu: Yep 
Jennifer Luo: And then the slope is 1/2 a Or g 
Michael Lu: 1/2 g So g is twice the m value desmos produces 
Jennifer Luo: Mhm thank you~ Also If I ask too many questions and it bothers you You can tell me okay I feel bad :(( 
Michael Lu: Lol no it's all good :)) 
Jennifer Luo: â¤ thank youuuuu~ 
Michael Lu: â¤ np Jen 
Jennifer Luo: Can I see your graph I have no idea how to use the table in Samoa *desmos I thought we needed to include all the values tho? 
Michael Lu: Where? :(( 
Jennifer Luo: ? 
Michael Lu: Ehh you mean 3 column table? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah? 
Michael Lu: :((((((((((((((((((((( Oke 
Jennifer Luo: Wait I'm not sure tho? 
Michael Lu: Eh andy did two column I'm too lazy to redo it 
Jennifer Luo: Lol 
Michael Lu: But if you want you can add another colum to the table 
Jennifer Luo: Nah I'll just do two 
Michael Lu: Cool beans ð¥ 
Jennifer Luo: Still can't see the emoji 
Michael Lu: :(( are you on a computer? 
Jennifer Luo: Phone I didn't update tho 
Michael Lu: Oh lol Ur missing out 
Jennifer Luo: I know :(( Me has another question:(( Plz help 
Michael Lu: Olah 
Jennifer Luo: So for the lab again It asked to compare the times when it was fired straight and like on an angle Is the angle time less because like, the vertical velocity is like less and the acceleration is the same? 
Michael Lu: Yah, but you don't have to explain it right? 
Jennifer Luo: We don't?? Oh 
Michael Lu: It didn't say to ;) 
Jennifer Luo: Welp okay then Thanksss Can I check my lab answers with yours tomorrow morning?

Michael Lu: Hi 
Jennifer Luo: ARE YOU OKAY 
Michael Lu: Yah as of now 
Jennifer Luo: as of now??? 
Michael Lu: :)) 
Jennifer Luo: What happened??? Concussion??? 
Michael Lu: Did she catch it? 
Jennifer Luo: .... Yes.... 
Michael Lu: Cool. 
Jennifer Luo: But what happened??? 
Michael Lu: I tripped over her because I was a M00K 
Jennifer Luo: Okay I know But like Do you have a concussion? 
Michael Lu: As of now, no Symptoms may occur later on 
Jennifer Luo: Awwwww 
Michael Lu: But as of now the doctor said no 
Jennifer Luo: Ahh okay Wait Did you go to the hospital?? 
Michael Lu: No 
Jennifer Luo: Oh :(( does it hurt? Wait that's stupid Of course it does 
Michael Lu: I guess kinda 
Jennifer Luo: :(( 
Michael Lu: :(( 
Jennifer Luo: Were you sleeping? 
Michael Lu: Yah 
Jennifer Luo: Ahhh 
Michael Lu: Lol sry for late reply :PP 
Jennifer Luo: Nah it's fine I was just worried Oh also 
Michael Lu: Thx :)) 
Jennifer Luo: Do you need the math notes? 
Michael Lu: Lol yah sure 
Jennifer Luo: Uh how Oh wait I'll send a pic here 
Michael Lu: Oke thx m8 
Jennifer Luo: Np~ Hope you feel better :)) 
Michael Lu: Did you do the harmonic series? 
Jennifer Luo: Nope Ran out of time 
Michael Lu: K How was comp sci? 
Jennifer Luo: We did one question And then watched videos 
Michael Lu: Eyyy that's legit 
Jennifer Luo: It was to write a method that would take a double parameter and multiply the length and width of the rectangle class by the factor And call it scale 
Michael Lu: Cool beans ð¥ 
Jennifer Luo: Can't see the emoji still ;(( 
Michael Lu: :((((((((( Did Mr. Dickson miss me? 
Jennifer Luo: Omg When I first told him you hit your head He said You're weak And then when he asked again The class was like WOAHH 
Michael Lu: lol wasn't my decision, he niece forced me 
Jennifer Luo: Idgi 
Michael Lu: Nurse* 
Jennifer Luo: Ohh 
Michael Lu: He asked again? Wat 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah Cuz like We were doing the proof And he was like Michael told us to do partial fractions And he was like where is he??? 
Michael Lu: LMAO Help pls :(( Can u explain the part before the def 
Jennifer Luo: Oh oops it says lining It should be limit 
Michael Lu: Oke 
Jennifer Luo: Do you still need me to explain? I'll take that as a yes 
Michael Lu: Yes 
Jennifer Luo: Uh So Sn is the series And if Sn has a limit as n goes to infinity The sum of the terms is the limit? Idk how to like explain that... 
Michael Lu: Is the limit of Sn a term of the sequence? 
Jennifer Luo: Uh no 
Michael Lu: Is it a convergence value? 
Jennifer Luo: It's the limit of the series Yeah Basically yeah 
Michael Lu: Didn't we learn this already? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah 
Michael Lu: Oh lol oke 
Jennifer Luo: That was just something he wrote down so I copied it Lol 
Michael Lu: What about the definition part? 
Jennifer Luo: So Sn is a series of the partial sum of another series 
Michael Lu: O_o 
Jennifer Luo: Oh Uh If uk1 + uk2 + uk3 +... is a series Sn can be defined as the series of partial sums So like uk1 + (uk1 + uk2) +... Right? 
Michael Lu: Yah 
Jennifer Luo: So as n goes to infinity, if Sn has a limit The limit of the original series is the same 
Michael Lu: Wait is Sn a series or sequence of partial sums? 
Jennifer Luo: Partial sums 
Michael Lu: Errr wat :(( 
Jennifer Luo: Uh hm What don't you get 
Michael Lu: Is Sn the original series? 
Jennifer Luo: No It's the partial sum 
Michael Lu: Is it a sequence or a series? 
Jennifer Luo: Series It's the partial sum series of another series 
Michael Lu: U wrote sequence :(( help 
Jennifer Luo: What???? Oh wait I meant to say sequence Fuckkkk I'm sorry :((((((((;( So it's the sequence of the partial sums of the series 
Michael Lu: Oke I see 
Jennifer Luo: :(( sorry 
Michael Lu: lol it's okeee ;) What about this part? 
Jennifer Luo: So those are 2 diff questions The one on the left Is a series that goes

1-1+1-... And you find the first few partial sums And when you put them into a sequence It obviously doesn't covege Coverage So the original series diverhes YeahV ? 
Michael Lu: ð 
Jennifer Luo: So for the right side On the top You basically list out the terms And you find the ratio And you find it diverges But if you wanna do it algebraicly you do it the bottom way To find the ratio 
Michael Lu: Did he explain telescoping sums? Like give a definition? 
Jennifer Luo: Nope He basically just said "We collapsed it" 
Michael Lu: With that expansion thingy? 
Jennifer Luo: What expansion thingy 
Michael Lu: Idk the thing he mentioned in class 
Jennifer Luo: What did he mention in class 
Michael Lu: On how to rewrite the series's formula 
Jennifer Luo: OH the partial fractions? 
Michael Lu: Yah 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah 
Michael Lu: Gdarn I forgot how to do it ð 
Jennifer Luo: But we had to first derive that 1/k(k+1) was equal to 1/k - 1/(k+1) 
Michael Lu: Is that partial fraction styff^ 
Jennifer Luo: Uh Yeah Cuz then we use that to break up the terms 
Michael Lu: How did you solve for k? 
Jennifer Luo: We never solved for k We just need one term to be 0 So that we can get A or B So we put k as -1 and 0 You don't get kfc It? 
Michael Lu: So... you just plug in something logical for k? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah To get one of them to be 0 TBH i don't get why it works But it does 
Michael Lu: Lol can u get ur precalc textbook? Don't they say you have to solve some system of equations? 
Jennifer Luo: I have jt What do WANT me to look at? 
Michael Lu: There should be a partial fraction expansion section 
Jennifer Luo: Where?? I don't see it 
Michael Lu: :((( 
Jennifer Luo: I would ask you to look for it butttttt lol you gave it in 
Michael Lu: Umm it's in one of the later chapters with systems of equations and matrices? Lol 
Jennifer Luo: Ohh Partial fractions decomposition? 
Michael Lu: Yah 
Jennifer Luo: This? 
Michael Lu: Umm, like that? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah 
Michael Lu: Okeee Sry if I was a nuisance XD 
Jennifer Luo: Nah it's fine Sorry for being almost no help :(( And you always help so yeah :))

Conversation:
Jennifer Luo: Helppp plzzz 
Michael Lu: Hi 
Jennifer Luo: Hi So Can you explain this theorem please? 
Michael Lu: Umm An increasing sequence must have an upper bound to converge, or it goes to infinity (diverges and no bound) 
Jennifer Luo: But then what's the difference between M and L 
Michael Lu: A decreasing sequence must have a lower bound to converge, or it goes to negative infinity (diverges and no bound) L is the limit at infinity Which may match the bound 
Jennifer Luo: Idgi What's the bound?? 
Michael Lu: M 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah but like What is it 
Michael Lu: ? 
Jennifer Luo: Like.... Uh If L is the limit as it goes to infinity what is M Like Why are. You comparing L to M 
Michael Lu: Because M has to be a value L doesn't, it can be infinity, I think 
Jennifer Luo: Idgiii :((((( 
Michael Lu: :(( 
Jennifer Luo: So can I just ignore M 
Michael Lu: What would u do without m 
Jennifer Luo: Uh like Can't you just say whether or not the L is a constant? 
Michael Lu: Sometimes u don't know what L is 
Jennifer Luo: Whatttt Idgi Aren't you gonna compare it to M? So don't you have to know the value?? 
Michael Lu: See the example 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah but There's no M I this example *in 
Michael Lu: It's 0, I didn't write it down 
Jennifer Luo: What I don't get it I didn't write it down either?? 
Michael Lu: Wait look at it it said M>= 0 
Jennifer Luo: Whatttt 
Michael Lu: Because the sequence is always positive 
Jennifer Luo: So M is always 0?? What 
Michael Lu: Should I call u? 
Jennifer Luo: Uh When I get home? 
Michael Lu: Lol are u at brown? 
Jennifer Luo: I'm in the car :(( 
Michael Lu: Oh how long until u get back?

Michael Lu: Lmao I linked up a bunch of paper clips 
Jennifer Luo: I can see... 
Michael Lu: And I might put them back linked up 
Jennifer Luo: Where do you even find that many?? LOL I'm just gonna say that the last method for the bonuses is really damn annoying ;(( Spent 2 hours of my life on it yet it still had problems *has 
Michael Lu: Lol ^ comp sci in a nutshell tho Reflect? You're talking about that one? 
Jennifer Luo: T r i g g e r e d Yeah It's so goddamn annoying 
Michael Lu: XD 
Jennifer Luo: I thought I found like a better way But it turns out It has sooooo many fucking weird things Sighsssssss I gave up lol 
Michael Lu: ;(( lol did u look it up yet? 
Jennifer Luo: I did When I first looked at it And I couldn't find a formula And if there is one I will be extremely triggered 
Michael Lu: XD 2 hrs? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah More like 2 and a half Kms 
Michael Lu: D E D I C A T I O N 
Jennifer Luo: On one method BUT IT STILL DOESNT WORK 100% OF THE TIME Tbh this project is more of a geo project than it is a comp sci 
Michael Lu: XD ruffff Fax Gotta ask Mr Dickson how to do 
Jennifer Luo: Lolllll Smae XD have you done any other methods? 
Michael Lu: Nah I was spending two hours on Tria HW 
Jennifer Luo: Awwwww :(( Neville's hw takes like 10 min So we both pretty much wasted 2 hours of our lives XD 
Michael Lu: Btw have you heard of Anthony Zhan the freshman who beat Ajay and Jaysen at AIME last year?

Michael Lu: Dam he tried out for Scioly 
Jennifer Luo: Got full score Woahhhhhh 
Michael Lu: Nah full score is impossible 
Jennifer Luo: No like Full score on the aime 
Michael Lu: Oh wtf 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah Smart afff On the first meeting 
Michael Lu: What did Ajay get? 
Jennifer Luo: We were all like WHO IS ANTHONY THE AIME KID I have no clue 
Michael Lu: Damm is he on math team? 
Jennifer Luo: Not full score tho :(( Yeahhhh 
Michael Lu: Good 
Jennifer Luo: Yup Honesty if he wasn't 
Michael Lu: seems O P 
Jennifer Luo: We'd all track him down Op? 
Michael Lu: Overpowered 
Jennifer Luo: Ohhhh Yeah Over 9000 XD 
Michael Lu: What does he look like? 
Jennifer Luo: Uhhhh Honestly I have no clue I keep mixing him up with all the other Asian math team freshies -.- 
Michael Lu: Aww 
Jennifer Luo: I know he's skinny But he ain't a stick like you :)) Do you know? 
Michael Lu: No I don't 
Jennifer Luo: Oh yeah How was proctoring Was it boring lol 
Michael Lu: Nah ethan Wang popped in 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah ik.... Sent some pictures 
Michael Lu: Oh. 
Jennifer Luo: XD 
Michael Lu: Lol ð 
Jennifer Luo: how did Brian do 
Michael Lu: It's secret :)) 
Jennifer Luo: Ooohhh Okeyy 
Michael Lu: Lol Daniel Lu tried out Time to start the java project :P 
Jennifer Luo: LOL have fun with that XD Hope you don't get as TRIGGERED as I did 
Michael Lu: Do you have a point to test reflection? 
Jennifer Luo: Across any line? Or a horizontal one 
Michael Lu: Nothing fancy 
Jennifer Luo: Or vertical What Reflect (1,1) across x=0 Idk 
Michael Lu: Any line :(( not vertical 
Jennifer Luo: Oh Uh Y= x Are you doing the last one? 
Michael Lu: Oh lmao I think it worked 
Jennifer Luo: Whattttttttttt Did you do the last one????? 
Michael Lu: Yeah reflect 
Jennifer Luo: Whatttt Fine do a harder one Uh (2,1) across y = 2x Btw I didn't test this so... 
Michael Lu: :(( 
Jennifer Luo: I can like do it now if you really tho ... (0.8, 1.6) Wait No hold up I didn't finish (-0.4, 2.2) I think? 
Michael Lu: Wait for what 
Jennifer Luo: The answer 
Michael Lu: What did you reflect 
Jennifer Luo: (2,1) Across y = 2x Oh wait So I guess the two points would be like (0,0) and (2,2)? 
Michael Lu: Yah I got 0.4, 2.2 
Jennifer Luo: I mean Wait Well yeah Damn it worked 
Michael Lu: Is that legit? 
Jennifer Luo: Hm? Oh wait It works for mine too lol 
Michael Lu: I think it's legit XD 
Jennifer Luo: Wait I'm confusing myself -.- Aghhhhh :((( you got it? 
Michael Lu: We got the same thing 
Jennifer Luo: Welllll Mine doesn't work in all cases so yeah How'd you do it? 
Michael Lu: Wdym cases 
Jennifer Luo: Like It doesn't work 100% of the time If the line and the point are in certain positions it doesn't work Did you do it the algebraic way? Using the equations? 
Michael Lu: I did perpendicular intersection 
Jennifer Luo: ??? From a point to a line? 
Michael Lu: Yah 
Jennifer Luo: Doesn't that only give you the length thoV ? 
Michael Lu: Draw a perpendicular to intersect the reflection line 
Jennifer Luo: What Okey I still don't get it 
Michael Lu: Intersection is point I and original point is P 
Jennifer Luo: Mhm 
Michael Lu: X change from P to I is equal to x distance from I to P' Same with Y 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah 
Michael Lu: So solve for I 
Jennifer Luo: So did you find point I? Oh okay 
Michael Lu: Yah 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah that way annoyed me So I didn't do it that way... 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Jennifer Luo: ;(( 
Michael Lu: What way are you using 
Jennifer Luo: Darn I used rotation 
Michael Lu: lol I was thinking about that Like Rotate the system 
Jennifer Luo: Oh what No 
Michael Lu: To make it vertical? 
Jennifer Luo: Like I found the angel between lines pa and an 
Michael Lu: Or rotate point around I? 
Jennifer Luo: *ab 
Michael Lu: Oh 
Jennifer Luo: And then I rotated the point around a But it doesn't work if they are in certain positions Sighs 
Michael Lu: :(( 
Jennifer Luo: :(( Sighs Can I see your work tomorrow I won't copy lol 
Michael Lu: Yah Do u have a pic? 
Jennifer Luo: Just wanna see how you did the algebra Uh yeah 
Michael Lu: Seeems complicated :)))

Jennifer Luo: LOL okay XD 
Michael Lu: Yay thanks ð ðð 
Jennifer Luo: Np~ 
Michael Lu: lol wait how did u derive ur angle rotation formula? 
Jennifer Luo: Uh I did law of cosines first To find the angle And then I doubled it and decided whether or not it should be negative And then rotated It's not really one formula :(( 
Michael Lu: Lol what time do you usually sleep? This late? 
Jennifer Luo: LOL around 12:30

Michael Lu: Should I make a new method just for 90 degree rotations? I'm too lazy :((((( 
Jennifer Luo: Inmean *i mean The bonus puts them separately so... I did? 
Michael Lu: :((( so much work 
Jennifer Luo: ... You could literally just copy your code but make it with a diff parameter 
Michael Lu: Yah but does the inside have to be different 
Jennifer Luo: I mean just the parameter nameB ? Cuz 90 and any angle makes no diff in that method so Might as well just have the same one 
Michael Lu: lol didn't u make different methods with different insides? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah... Cuz I'm extra like that lol jkjk It's just I didn't wanna deal with cosines and sines twixe Twice Cuz you get weird decimals 
Michael Lu: Lol u right ð 
Jennifer Luo: XD 
Michael Lu: Tfw u comment so much the green hurts :(( 
Jennifer Luo: XD how is that possible?? Green is you And you is green 
Michael Lu: Idk if the method is named isRectangle 
Jennifer Luo: ? 
Michael Lu: And I commented this method checks if the quadrilaterals a rectangle 
Jennifer Luo: Wait but That's so..... 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Jennifer Luo: Obvious.... 
Michael Lu: Yah ik But gotta make comments :)))( 
Jennifer Luo: I'm not even gonna comment some of the quad stuff LOL 
Michael Lu: We don't have to put stuff in the driver class right? 
Jennifer Luo: I mean... He said that we use it to test methods?? Idk what to do with it 
Michael Lu: It isn't he supposed t test them? 
Jennifer Luo: Probably just gonna like test all my methods I have no clue 
Michael Lu: I'll ask tmrw 
Jennifer Luo: I mean yeah Yeah good luck with that

Michael Lu: This is why I didn't use the CAS 
Jennifer Luo: Oh lol But what did you use that for? 
Michael Lu: Physics lab 
Jennifer Luo: Ohhhh Dang I need to start that :(( 
Michael Lu: Lol ð It was fun hanging out with you :)) And Ethan :)) 
Jennifer Luo: Yahhh it was liiiitttt We should do it again when we all succeed XD Okay so I kinda need to rant about something Lmk when you have time 
Michael Lu: Umm lol what's up? 
Jennifer Luo: Tbh this involves you to Too So like yam is really pissing me off Did he block you too?? 
Michael Lu: No? 
Jennifer Luo: Wtf??? Okay that just makes me angrier wtf So he says that he needs time to clear his head and think things through???? 
Michael Lu: Umm he blocked u? Did he give that as a reason? 
Jennifer Luo: But I find out because I tried to reply to his messages but I'm fucking blocked??? And then I text him to ask him what's wrong And he tells me to ask Ethan to explain Like he wouldn't even explain it to me himself And when Ethan had no way to explain then he finally stepped in 
Michael Lu: When was this? 
Jennifer Luo: JUST NOW AKA 20 MIN AGO It's as if he gets to decide when we can be friends and when we can't??? He says he did it this way so I don't get pissed off but why wouldn't I get pissed off if he doesn't even have the damn balls to even tell me himself??? Sighs He's cutting off all negative things that affect him Aka me and you??? Like honestly do you get this?? Cuz I most definitely don't Also pretty sure I shouldn't be telling you this but I really
Dgaf 
Michael Lu: Yeah... I think he's kinda in a state of shock or something. 
Jennifer Luo: But why would he think that this is okay?!? 
Michael Lu: And for people like him, the only way to escape it is to go to extreme measures 
Jennifer Luo: But if he just told me he needed time to think I would've underdtood Like I get it But to do things in such an abrupt way is just unacceptable??? 
Michael Lu: So he messaged you, blocked you, then told ethan to elaborate? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah And then he ended up having to explain to me since Ethan couldn't explain 
Michael Lu: Darn. 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah Sighs Sorry for dragging you into all this 
Michael Lu: Nah it's all good 
Jennifer Luo: I just don't get why he's being so irrational and looking so deep into things sighs 
Michael Lu: He's probably not ready for these events of great social weight. :(( 
Jennifer Luo: Sighssssss 
Michael Lu: He doesn't want to hurt you 
Jennifer Luo: He was never so difficult before junior year ;(( Oh yeah suuuuure 
Michael Lu: He's probably just oblivious. Unfortunately. Even though what he does can be really bad. 
Jennifer Luo: Sighs I guess ;(( Tbh not gonna get over this for a looooooooong time 
Michael Lu: I'm sure it'll take a while, especially since it's him. 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah I guess sighs So that's why he probably won't talk to you either 
Michael Lu: He talked to me earlier today 
Jennifer Luo: Tf Wait actually smae After the sat 
Michael Lu: Hmm I think he found out about the dinner. I suspect. 
Jennifer Luo: He keeps over analyzing things idgi Sighs 
Michael Lu: TBH, See what he does in Tuesday. 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah i guess I'll
Probably just ignore him until then ;(( Sighssssssssss 
Michael Lu: Yeah, be ready to give him some time. 
Jennifer Luo: Mhm 
Michael Lu: Don't worry about him he'll find his way. 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah but he probably just destroyed our friendship tonight Idk whatever 
Michael Lu: I feel like he's going thru low key 5 stages of grief 
Jennifer Luo: .... But that's so extreme 
Michael Lu: 5 stages of "a little shook" 
Jennifer Luo: LOL "A little shook" More like "Very shocked" *shooked 
Michael Lu: Yeah I guess so :;( 
Jennifer Luo: Sighs Well thanks For listening :)) 
Michael Lu: Np I'll always be listening if u need me :)) And he blocked me...

Michael Lu: Lol 
Jennifer Luo: I wish there was a sticker for Ethan's finger FINS *guns 
Michael Lu: ðð 
Jennifer Luo: OMG LOL ðð 
Michael Lu: Can u tell me when you finish the physics lab? Gotta check the mathsssss :)) 
Jennifer Luo: Yah I'll probably do it either tonight or tomorrow 
Michael Lu: Cool beans ð¥ð¥ð¥ :)) 
Jennifer Luo: Wait I can see the emojis on my iPad but not on my phone.
. ... 
Michael Lu: :O 
Jennifer Luo: For the lab, which angle did you use to calculate the initial velocity? 
Michael Lu: 90 degrees 
Jennifer Luo: Okey 
Michael Lu: Are you able to message William I. Messenger? 
Jennifer Luo: I refuse to message him 
Michael Lu: I mean check if your able to 
Jennifer Luo: But if I am It would send And I don't want it to send 
Michael Lu: You mean it would tell him u saw his messages? 
Jennifer Luo: What messages I just don't wanna message him 
Michael Lu: No I mean check if you are able to Don't send anything 
Jennifer Luo: Idgi Like if it will send?? 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Jennifer Luo: Idgi How does that work Oh I see It says I can't respond to his messages 
Michael Lu: Like when he blocked me I couldn't type anything g 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah I can't type anything What's happening? 
Michael Lu: Okay He "fixed" his chat glitch and I can message him now. But only after I asked Jen Wang If she could message him 
Jennifer Luo: What Yeah it's fixed for me too Wth 
Michael Lu: Whatever 
Jennifer Luo: -.- Idgi 
Michael Lu: Kinda pissed if William is lying about a chat "glitch" 
Jennifer Luo: Same tho But I'm already pissed sooo ð Is it weird that rn I wish I was back with you and Ethan again :(( 
Michael Lu: Lol no I do too That was a good time :(( Life is boring w/o trend Frens* 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah :(( Life is stressful without funny mooks Wait when you measured the wood block for the lab 
Michael Lu: Flip the angles 
Jennifer Luo: You measured the angle of the block right So we need to subtract? From 90? 
Michael Lu: 90 - what we wrote down yah 
Jennifer Luo: Okey Also How did you use the 90 angle for the calculation??? 
Michael Lu: Plug in air time and solve for initial velocity 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah but like We never had a 90 degree launch?? 
Michael Lu: The 3 times we recorded firing straight up 
Jennifer Luo: OHHH I totally forgot about those -.- 
Michael Lu: Lol ð 
Jennifer Luo: Did you use the average times? 
Michael Lu: I used the smallest 
Jennifer Luo: Oh okey Then I'll do that too lol 
Michael Lu: Because it gave me the smallest percent error ;) 
Jennifer Luo: So we can check math LMAO Wtf is wrong with my graph... Wait nvm But I'm getting a really small bum... Help plz :((( 
Michael Lu: A way? Wat* 
Jennifer Luo: My graph is weirdddd I'm getting v to be like 4 or something :(( Ohhhh I was in radians -.- I'm stupid 
Michael Lu: LMAO 
Jennifer Luo: :(((((( 
Michael Lu: Awwww XD 
Jennifer Luo: Can I check my math after I finish? 
Michael Lu: Yas 
Jennifer Luo: I spent forever trying to fix it only to realize it was in radians Kmsss 
Michael Lu: :P 
Jennifer Luo: When you did percent difference did you divide by the free fall or the projectile launch velocity Is the same as doing percent error? 
Michael Lu: I divided by free fall, whatever one you think is the more accurate one 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah okey So I realized that we can't compare math... Because I think you used y=mx and not y=mx + b 
Michael Lu: Do I have to use b? 
Jennifer Luo: Nah I don't think so It just makes it more accurate 
Michael Lu: Oh lol okeee Did u finish the lab? :)) 
Jennifer Luo: Yah I finished it earlier Still wanna compare stuff??? 
Michael Lu: Yah 
Jennifer Luo: Mkay What'd you get for the initial velocity 
Michael Lu: 20.48 Using 4.18 Second 
Jennifer Luo: Yah Smae And then..... All our other values are off I think -.- 
Michael Lu: What did u plot 
Jennifer Luo: y = 38.6709x - 4.25086 I got a 4.95% error :)))) 
Michael Lu: Aw u used b XD 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah :(( 
Michael Lu: I had 10% error 
Jennifer Luo: What'd you getV ? HA 5% HAAAAA 
Michael Lu: 20.48 
Jennifer Luo: ?? Wat 
Michael Lu: I mean I got 18.34 for projectile 
Jennifer Luo: I got 19.4673 for projectile 
Michael Lu: Gdarn did  u graph r vs sin(2 * theta)? 
Jennifer Luo: Yah 
Michael Lu: Lol what title 
Jennifer Luo: Range vs. sin(2 * angle) 
Michael Lu: Lmao 
Jennifer Luo: What did you use 
Michael Lu: Saem 
Jennifer Luo: LOL It made sense that our largest range came from 40 degrees right 
Michael Lu: Yep lol Close enough 
Jennifer Luo: lol YAHH *yah 
Michael Lu: Oh darn percent diff isn't percent error :O 
Jennifer Luo: Whattttt What is it then... 
Michael Lu: Diff/avg * 100 
Jennifer Luo: Ohhhh okey thanks 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Steve jobs pose 
Jennifer Luo: LOL he wishes he could be the next Steve jobs Did you do the math homework yet 
Michael Lu: Not yet Yes 
Jennifer Luo: Dang What 
Michael Lu: I did Misclick 
Jennifer Luo: Limit comparison? 
Michael Lu: Yah 
Jennifer Luo: What did you compare number 8 to Wait whatttt How do you know it's less than?? 
Michael Lu: Which 
Jennifer Luo: Number 8 Like how do you know it's less than 1/k 
Michael Lu: Smaller denominator 
Jennifer Luo: But the numerator is bigger?? 
Michael Lu: It's really k^2/k^3 
Jennifer Luo: I still don't get it :(( 
Michael Lu: Yeah the numerator shrank 
Jennifer Luo: Whattt 
Michael Lu: But the denominator shrank too and shrank more 
Jennifer Luo: But.... Hm I don't get it tho... They both change so can't you like Not assume that it's smaller... 
Michael Lu: Look at the terms The denominator was affected more 
Jennifer Luo: .... Oh... 
Michael Lu: Remember when Dickson said disregard everything but the leading terms 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah? 
Michael Lu: That's what I did 
Jennifer Luo: But the leading terms are k^2/k^3 Which is equal to 1/k 
Michael Lu: Yah which reduces Yah 
Jennifer Luo: BUT BUT Do you just assume that it's greater than... 
Michael Lu: The original series' denominator is so much bigger tho 
Jennifer Luo: Okay then.... 
Michael Lu: Plug in 1 :) 
Jennifer Luo: I mean I guess.... But I still don't get why ;(( Sighsssss Oh wait..... You don't even need to do that tho?? 
Michael Lu: Lol what do u do 
Jennifer Luo: The limit comparison test?? 
Michael Lu: Yah 
Jennifer Luo: So... You don't have to compare the series with each other?? 
Michael Lu: U do 
Jennifer Luo: What What.... 
Michael Lu: When is ur graham conference? 
Jennifer Luo: Like... the 23rd? Or the 26? I can't remember 
Michael Lu: Lol ð

Michael Lu: lol what's up 
Jennifer Luo: Number 15 I got that it diverges absolutely but I'm stuck now Oh it asks to classify it 
Michael Lu: Wait how did u get diverges abs 
Jennifer Luo: Uh the ratio test for absolute convergence 
Michael Lu: Oh yah good point XD 
Jennifer Luo: >< 
Michael Lu: Hmmm doesn't the ratio test for absolute prove it diverges 
Jennifer Luo: WHATT *what Doesn't it only prove absolute OH WAIT TFFFF yeah you're right :(( My notes were wrong asdf 
Michael Lu: Am I? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah Textbook says you're right 
Michael Lu: Lol i didn't think that it would work 
Jennifer Luo: :(( I'm dumb Sighs 
Michael Lu: :p Dw man 
Jennifer Luo: THERE ARE 9 TESTS I AM VERY WORRIED 
Michael Lu: Yah but 1 is a scam (divergence test) 2 are the same (ratio tests) 
Jennifer Luo: But it still counts as one :(((((((( Still count thoooo Tbh it probably doesn't help that I'm watching a drama while doing questions buuuutttt.... yeah 
Michael Lu: Lmao

Michael Lu: And at lunch? 
Jennifer Luo: Yah 
Michael Lu: Yah I'll join u :)) 
Jennifer Luo: Yayy But like For a lot of the classification ones I end up using the ratio test for absolute convergence?? It feels so wrong :(( 
Michael Lu: No it is legit It's either that or the alternating series test 
Jennifer Luo: Wanna explain something I me tomorrow Mm *to Okey Thanksss 
Michael Lu: Np :)) 
Jennifer Luo: If Stephen meant jen Wang He is a prophet

Conversation:
Jennifer Luo: Help plz :((((( 
Michael Lu: No negative sign 
Jennifer Luo: I tried that And it didn't work :(( 
Michael Lu: 33 + 12 
Jennifer Luo: 45? 
Michael Lu: It said ||A + B|| = 12 
Jennifer Luo: Idgi They're going in opposite directions tho? 
Michael Lu: A and B yas 
Jennifer Luo: So why don't you subtract?? Wait... 45 is correct Idgi 
Michael Lu: Because B has to be larger in magnitude than A to switch direction 
Jennifer Luo: OHHHHHHHH 
Michael Lu: :)) 
Jennifer Luo: okay I get it Thanks~ 
Michael Lu: Lol he gave u the extension right? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah I finished just now lol With a grand total of 71.4%

Michael Lu: lol whatevs :)) 
Jennifer Luo: Nooooooooooo I'm wrong then :((( But me is too lazy to check again 
Michael Lu: wait i'll just go to 3 decimal places :/ gotta reprint 
Jennifer Luo: LOL YOU ACTUALLY PRINTED THE NOTABILITY PAGE??? 
Michael Lu: 0.737 - 1.303 
Jennifer Luo: :(((( 
Michael Lu: ? 
Jennifer Luo: I thought we had the same values when we checked at sbv *sb? Wait wtf I'm retarded I wrote 0.7371 on my line but not for my answer I'm so stupid 
Michael Lu: :(( printing 
Jennifer Luo: Should I print mine?? Don't really wanna copy it into paper *onto 
Michael Lu: idk if u want XD 
Jennifer Luo: Hm But then he'll get mad :(( 
Michael Lu: he likes u tho

Jennifer Luo: But they know I'm stupid And that Wang is too mook 
Michael Lu: nah they think our entire table is smart 
Jennifer Luo: "Entire table" 
Michael Lu: \_(e_e)_/ 
Jennifer Luo: XD But the question isn't really that hard tho?? Idk man Maybe it's us?? Like Patrick was completely lost 
Michael Lu: :(( 
Jennifer Luo: What's wrong? Did more people ask?

Conversation:
Jennifer Luo: Did you do the math hw? The last question on the ditto? 
Michael Lu: Yah 
Jennifer Luo: What'd you get for the first part 
Michael Lu: 9/2? 
Jennifer Luo: !!! Woahhh i did it right XD but I'm stuck on the second part :(( Helpppp plzzz 
Michael Lu: Get it in point slope form 
Jennifer Luo: What So did you use -2/w^3 as the slope? 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Jennifer Luo: Oh okay And then solve for k right 
Michael Lu: Use linear approximation formula Yeah 
Jennifer Luo: What Why'd you use the linear approximation formula?? 
Michael Lu: You can use point slope form wat ever 
Jennifer Luo: Wait whattttt Idgiiiii 
Michael Lu: But you gotta set up an equation for the tangent line to the function 
Jennifer Luo: What I'm so lost rn 
Michael Lu: Find the equation of line l 
Jennifer Luo: Uh Point slope right 
Michael Lu: Yah 
Jennifer Luo: Okay And then? 
Michael Lu: Plug invalids with relevant variables, values, and expressions: dy/dx, x, y, x0, y0 
Jennifer Luo: ....... ... What I don't get it 
Michael Lu: y = m(x - x0) + y0 What's m 
Jennifer Luo: -2/w^3 Right? 
Michael Lu: Yah what's x0 
Jennifer Luo: Um K? 
Michael Lu: w 
Jennifer Luo: What 
Michael Lu: K is the x intercept 
Jennifer Luo: Okay? Why can't you use k? 
Michael Lu: W is the point shared by the tangent line and the function 
Jennifer Luo: Wait what are you solving for them??? *then 
Michael Lu: Hold on What's y0 If x0 = w 
Jennifer Luo: Uh 1/w^2? 
Michael Lu: Ya Now we are solving for k, which is the x intercept 
Jennifer Luo: Wait but Why did you use those values for x0 and y0 
Michael Lu: So set y = 0 Because that's the point of tangency 
Jennifer Luo: .... Um 
Michael Lu: The solution to the tangent line and the function 
Jennifer Luo: Okay? Wait a second I don't know how to use point slope form... :(( 
Michael Lu: It's just algebra tho y = 0, x = k Solve for k 
Jennifer Luo: I only know how to do things with the regular form... Wait but What do x0 and y0 represent Idgi 
Michael Lu: Those are the coords of a point that has to be on the line for sure 
Jennifer Luo: Oh So you use that point to find the equation of the line? And then you plug in 0 and k 
Michael Lu: Yah 
Jennifer Luo: And solve? 
Michael Lu: Yah 
Jennifer Luo: Ohhhh okeyyyy Thank :))) 
Michael Lu: Np lmk if u get 1.5w 
Jennifer Luo: Okey 
Michael Lu: ð¥ 
Jennifer Luo: Wait.... I got -0.5w?? Wait oops nvm I got 1.5w :)) ð¥

Conversation:
Jennifer Luo: Hi~ Can you help me plz :(( 
Michael Lu: Yah what's up fam? 
Jennifer Luo: So for the lab, the second part is about changing the weights right How do m and a in this case like relate? Idgi 
Michael Lu: Wdym 
Jennifer Luo: Like As m increases what happens to A and fnet Like I know a stays the same because of the graph But i Don't get like why 
Michael Lu: Fnet increases as m increases So a stays the same I think 
Jennifer Luo: Oh But if m increased and a decreased wouldn't fnet be the same? 
Michael Lu: A doesn't change based on mass M increases, then Fnet increases (more gravity) 
Jennifer Luo: I don't get the diagram :(( Why is a =mgsintheta / m 
Michael Lu: a = Fnet/m Fnet, the force component parallel to the incline, is Fg * sin(theta) 
Jennifer Luo: Why is fnet parallel to the incline? 
Michael Lu: Fudge = mudge :)) 
Jennifer Luo: Because it's moving down?? 
Michael Lu: The parallel component of fudge determines how the object accelerates down the incline 
Jennifer Luo: Ohhhhh Did we learn that? 
Michael Lu: Not rlly 
Jennifer Luo: Oh lol okeyy Thank youuu :))) 
Michael Lu: :)) 
Jennifer Luo: :)) Woahhh you're up late!!

Michael Lu: Open the.java file with dr java 
Jennifer Luo: What I did 
Michael Lu: And then 
Jennifer Luo: I compoled Compiled And it didn't work Same error 
Michael Lu: What if You create a java class in dr java Then copy and paste the code instead 
Jennifer Luo: Idgi What's the diff 
Michael Lu: DrJava might autocratically create the files needed Automatically* 
Jennifer Luo: What do you mean by make a class And then copy paste 
Michael Lu: File -> new java class 
Jennifer Luo: Oh That's what I've been doing the whole time? 
Michael Lu: Didn't you download half ur classes? 
Jennifer Luo: No? I like copied the code into a new file in dr. Java? Isn't that the same thing? 
Michael Lu: Try it Create a new class then input the name 
Jennifer Luo: I is confised Confused I pressed downlad Download But it didnt What 
Michael Lu: In dr java File -> new class Nvm ur on a mac 
Jennifer Luo: No yeah okay And then I save 
Michael Lu: Screenshot ples 
Jennifer Luo: Still only have java file 
Michael Lu: So you created a new file, copy pasted code, then saved? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah

Jennifer Luo: Oh wait I need to make the other one too hold on OH IT WORKED 
Michael Lu: Legit? 
Jennifer Luo: yahhhhhh 
Michael Lu: :)) sry it took so long 
Jennifer Luo: Wait no It only half worked 
Michael Lu: :/ 
Jennifer Luo: Only one of them got a .class? 
Michael Lu: Compile the other file You have to compile each file to create the .class I think 
Jennifer Luo: Oh there's an error 
Michael Lu: Wat 
Jennifer Luo: Wait I compiled it Still only one class file 
Michael Lu: Did you compile drawing panel and drawing panel test? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah 
Michael Lu: Which one has a class file? 
Jennifer Luo: Test doesn't have a class file 
Michael Lu: Did you copy paste test? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah I copied paste for both 
Michael Lu: So, does the code run? 
Jennifer Luo: Uh hold on Oh it doesn't work cuz I commented out a part with an error It adds the panel to the pane But there's an error 
Michael Lu: :/ 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah :(( But it should be fine when I figure this last damn thing out

Michael Lu: Does the other class compile without error??? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah Just this one 
Michael Lu: So this is the only error? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah 
Michael Lu: Send a screenshot of testpanel code 
Jennifer Luo: WAIT NO WHAT THE SAME THING CAME BACK

Michael Lu: I got the car one wrong M and 2M compare the accelerations 
Jennifer Luo: Ohhh They're the same That was so wonky 
Michael Lu: Tf Why tho? 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah do the math I did the math and. They came out the same 
Michael Lu: Doesn't the normal force double? Oh wait 
Jennifer Luo: Yeah 
Michael Lu: Im a dumbass Yeah ur right 
Jennifer Luo: No you're not -.- 
Michael Lu: Fml 
Jennifer Luo: Awww it's okay Did you use two tries already? 
Michael Lu: I did it in my head but I forgot to multiply by 2 for the acceleration 
Jennifer Luo: Oh lol 
Michael Lu: Yeah I got it completely wrong :( 
Jennifer Luo: Awww :(( There are 5 kids in my room asking about physics And one is asking about friction 
Michael Lu: Lol asking u? 
Jennifer Luo: Nonono The teacher Don't wanna talk to these random strangers

Jennifer Wang: 3 teams: 15 members each. A Team is the best (we go to invitationals, regionals, states, and hopefully nationals competitions), B and C team go to regionals and maybe invitationals. you place by how well you do in an event. (each person has 3-4 events and 1-2 partners in each event) for example last year my events were anatomy and phys (w/ adrian), invasive species (with your sis), and remote sensing (with vivian lim) I got 3, 4, 5th place

Conversation:
Jennifer Wang: litty read my confession pls @1702

My theory: Science Olympiad doesn't exist. Let me explain why.

Every year as we draw to the close of the Science Olympiad admissions process, hundreds of students are waiting with drawn breath for Friday, when Science Olympiad will release their decisions. I was one of these students, until I stumbled upon revelations that have shaken me to the core and caused me to realize the true nature of SciOly. I share this as a warning, with the hope that one day the terrible truth will come to light: SciOly isnât real.
First, we should make some observations. Science Olympiad, or âSciOlyâ as I will refer to it occasionally, has one of the most mysterious tryout processes in this school. This will be important later. Second, SciOly is considered one of the most âprestigiousâ clubs in the school and has an exceptionally low acceptance rate. It has alumni with a wide range of accomplishments and talents, and is generally listed as one of the worldâs best padders for your college application.
Now despite all this, let me ask, have you ever really seen anyone from âSciOlyâ? Have you ever met someone who actually got in the club? Sure people say they tried out and got in, but then what? Nothing, never to be seen again. Take a look at their Facebook group: the group looks legit right? But who are all these âpeopleâ? Who is this âLitty Lingâ? These blatantly fake members such as âSwollan Leeâ, âLiterally Smaedrianâ, and âYuhungry forsome Cantaliupes.â
Now, hereâs the explanation. SciOly does not exist. The tryout test, although obviously real, is a mere prop to fool everyone. They can accomplish this by rejecting every student trying out, and pocketing their hopes and dreams in order to keep the âclubâ looking good. When you try out for âSciolyâ, you are not actually trying out for a legitimate club but rather selling your soul to a mysterious organization. The board members? All paid actors. The pictures? All fake. The candy? All sponsored by Best Market. There is no âSciOlyâ, but rather a fake âclubâ built on a network of lies.
Obviously, you probably think this is complete nonsense. âWhat about my friend?â you ask. âHeâs a freshman in SciOly right now!â But tell me, when was the last time you saw him? âOh he got onto A-Team and is busy studying!â You sure? Perhaps he was paid off with some excess funds to âattendâ these so-called âSciOlyâ meetings.
Finally, the âalumniâ. Let me ask you a hypothetical question. Imagine you, through hard work and some luck, rose to the top of the college application process and got into HYPSM+. All your peers were involved in DECA, HOSA, and similar clubs, while you didnât join any clubs. Itâd make you feel pretty small, right? But what if you were approached by someone from âSciOlyâ saying they could register you as an official alumni for a simple one-time payment? I donât know about you, but Iâd take the deal. And so would many others, leading to a self-fulfilling cycle where people become âalumniâ in order to increase their social status, therefore making SciOly seem more prestigious and attractive.
What we see as one of the most competitive and selective clubs in the school is merely one giant illusion to keep the schoolâs greatest minds at bay, one impossible tryout exam at a time. Stay woke my friends, and stay safe.

Jennifer Wang: I just wanna hug everyone :( 
Michael Lu: Si senior! 
Jennifer Wang: Can I at least post a pic of us from cpw with 0 context :o 
Michael Lu: Rrrr maybe ;) When is cpw 
Jennifer Wang: I hope they get off waitlists but itâs a far reach to come off 
Michael Lu: When does waitlist come out? 
Jennifer Wang: so most schools, after may 1 BC they have to look at the yield of their incoming class 
Michael Lu: But like Donât ppl commit before 
Jennifer Wang: Then they figure out how many if any to let in rom waitlist, waitlist basically exists to protect yield I think most waitlists come out after but Iâll check on that 
Michael Lu: Did nick chae commit after may 1st? 
Jennifer Wang: He commmitted to northwestern first right? I asked will Cai and like heâs gonna commit to Berkeley and then wait for waitlists after May 1 
Michael Lu: But like Commit? Then switch? How? 
Jennifer Wang: Just like commit first Youâre allowed to break commit to first school if u get off a waitlist if that makes sense 
Michael Lu: So itâs legal to break commit For waitlist 
Jennifer Wang: Yes BC u donât find out u get in until after May 1 Percentage accepted off waitlist is so low âEven if you decide to remain on the waiting list, prepare to attend another college. Choose the best fit from the colleges that accepted you, fill out the paperwork and send a deposit. Youâll forfeit this deposit if the college that waitlisted you offers you a place and you accept. Still, you need to be sure you have a place in an incoming freshman class next fall.â Thatâs from colllegeboard 
Michael Lu: ð 
Jennifer Wang: lettuce F for our grade but like Iâm so proud of u !!!!! what time are u getting there for CPW ?

Jennifer Wang: meta-asian 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Just curious Why did u choose MIT over Yale (disregarding what happened after May 1st ð) Veronica is learning towards MIT but considering Yale 
Jennifer Wang: Yale is not a stem school Thereâs no stem culture Itâs not even like just ânot-STEMâ Itâs hugely wonderful for arts and history and the most fuzzy of majors Yale doesnât really have a strong nerd culture I think in comparison to strong stem schools And Yale has more of the old school Harvard Yale Princeton old money vibes which I donât like Like rich white dudes vibe But Yale ppl seem super nice and the facilities are amazing and the access and personalized attention is great another thing I was concerned about was that I felt very unsafe on the borders of campus like cambridge feels much nicer Like u can wander out without getting shivvedq Yale is actually great though but it depends on what sheâs looking for in a school if sheâs doing engineering tell her to do MIT 
Michael Lu: Yesssss okeeeeee 


Conversation:
Jennifer Wang: lettuce are they gonna delay ur semester system from starting like in august cause my school cancelled stuff in august and early september 
Michael Lu: Mmm not sure yet Is quite a possibility tho When did they release cancel news 
Jennifer Wang: well they told us they weren't gonna do summer classes in person which for us is july/august and they cancelled prefrosh summer programs that are the month of august for like 4 weeks and they cancelled the 3-week programs in september i think about a week ago they also delayed our housing draw process for next year "indefinitely" 
Michael Lu: Oof Isnât/wasnât it pretty hectic in California? 
Jennifer Wang: they might just be busy i guess so they're pushing it off 
Michael Lu: Obv not as bad as NY 
Jennifer Wang: cali is peaking pretty soon after NY prob like May? but idk what they're planning on doing in the period of time AFTER the peak but there are still cases like all our stuff is still on campus rip ny lol 
Michael Lu: Rrrrrrrrip Wait r they cancelling the semester for u then or just the quarter 
Jennifer Wang: wait wdym the stuff that is cancelled are like summer programs our summer programs just run into september cause fall quarter starts at the very end of september 
Michael Lu: Like fall quarter + winter quarter? Because I feel like if other schools were to cancel theyâd cancel the entire semester 
Jennifer Wang: ohhh that would be crazy though but i can't imagine another semester/quarter of online cause i cant take any lab classes and my friends have mad studio/building classes they need stem school vibes cant live online i think for stanford they'll just end up following what the semester school systems do cause y'all start earlier have u heard anything from ur admin yet about delaying/cancelling 
Michael Lu: Havenât heard anything yet But if semester  gets canceled some ppl will said they might take a leave of absence 
Jennifer Wang: some people took a leave of absence this quarter (spring) cause we had an option of starting the quarter instead of continuing the semester like u guys did 
Michael Lu: Waiitttt lmao 
Jennifer Wang: we have a new leave of absence policy lmaoo 
Michael Lu: Me Jealous 
Jennifer Wang: but it's weird now cause everything is off kilter also $$$ for a shittier than khan academy online learning cause khan academy videos actually built for online instruction while half my profs are ancient non techy ppl lol 
Michael Lu: Yesssss lmao Did U see any of the MIT college posts Where ppl change their university To MIT OCW 
Jennifer Wang: Wait I heard from my friend His sister is starting at Stanford next yr And they got email that fall quarter may be cancelled Like itâs a possibility Idk how sure that is tho but theyâre probably just giving a heads up It would be so sad if like two years of our undergrad and intermittently on and offline 
Michael Lu: Oof 2 years of no GPA

Michael Lu: wut im working on the SUMO ai 
Jeremy Chen: wow r u srs 
Michael Lu: almost done The AI is pretty difficult 
Jeremy Chen: it sucks doe just help me with this 
Michael Lu: it knocks me off the screen a lot wut you want 
Jeremy Chen: i have layout its dynamic with an aspect ratio 
Michael Lu: send meeeeeee 
Jeremy Chen: every time u resize it refreshes 
Michael Lu: lemme see 
Jeremy Chen: skype 
Michael Lu: not today can't 
Jeremy Chen: ok ur on facebook right now tho 
Michael Lu: i can't voice cat on skype though chat* 
Jeremy Chen: so u just have to watch my screen 
Michael Lu: ... Can we do this on the weekend 
Jeremy Chen: fine then why are u doing the ai like a butthole 
Michael Lu: I wanna finish sumo quickly 
Jeremy Chen: wow 
Michael Lu: so I can work on the new game 
Jeremy Chen: ok ill let u work just know i am a god and i have dynamic positioning as well 
Michael Lu: ok 
Jeremy Chen: just so u no everything and anything has to be relative to the width and height of the canvas also what did u say we should use instead of setinterval cuz it doesnt continue when u switch tabs 
Michael Lu: hold on, lemme find it https://www.codecademy.com/LittyLing/codebits/mQcfYb/edit idk look at the code and copy the first function 
Jeremy Chen: wow what a butt 
Michael Lu: (function(){
    var requestAnimationFrame = window.requestAnimationFrame || window.msRequestAnimationFrame || window.mozRequestAnimationFrame || window.webkitRequestAnimationFrame;
    window.requestAnimationFrame = requestAnimationFrame;
    })(); requestAnimationFrame(update); window.onload = function() {
    update();
    }; 
Jeremy Chen: ok 
Michael Lu: use those idk 
Jeremy Chen: request animation frame 
Michael Lu: what's ur main function called 
Jeremy Chen: ? 
Michael Lu: do you have a main function? 
Jeremy Chen: o its tick 
Michael Lu: tick? function tick() {};? 
Jeremy Chen: yea 
Michael Lu: inside tick at the end put requestAnimationFrame(tick); 
Jeremy Chen: is it built in 
Michael Lu: what you mean? 
Jeremy Chen: how did u get it in 
Michael Lu: put it inside the function, after all the other stuff inside tick 
Jeremy Chen: no as in the requestanimationframe variable 
Michael Lu: that is from 
Jeremy Chen: like at the top u had a function 
Michael Lu: the top function the wierd one put that at the top of the program 
Jeremy Chen: doesnt that  var not get accessed tho 
Michael Lu: it does idk how idk what it does 
Jeremy Chen: lol 
Michael Lu: but it works nicely 
Jeremy Chen: internet still seems to pause when u leave but well work it ou t 
Michael Lu: yeah good https://www.codecademy.com/LittyLing/codebits/5mfkzR/edit does the ai work nice? 
Jeremy Chen: ? but we dont want it to pause.... also the ai is predictable af and its dumb 
Michael Lu: lol watever 
Jeremy Chen: idk this is rlly hard to have it variably change ok im just gonna stop for now we have to keep everything relative to x/16 and y/6 so i have variables that we can change to change the coordinate cuz the position is based off of x/16 times that variable 
Michael Lu: ok 
Jeremy Chen: its really hard to make it relative honestly mai gawd can u tell if two this overlap as in if like a circle touches a rectangle 
Michael Lu: use distance formula just wait for me jeez jermy 
Jeremy Chen: noooooo 
Michael Lu: did enoch do anything? 
Jeremy Chen: no

Michael Lu: i know but how do you know which line number the section is at? 
Jeremy Chen: no i mean across different projects in total they have like 5k but each class is like 600 i just look through for the function names 
Michael Lu: oh well JS ain't like that there is a big main function with everything in it 
Jeremy Chen: u can put function names no 
Michael Lu: nah 
Jeremy Chen: it depends on how u organize it 
Michael Lu: that's how I organize all my JS canvas games 
Jeremy Chen: sheeet hm i was gonna organize my calculator but i just stuffed it into one class 
Michael Lu: nice job

Conversation:
Jeremy Chen: wow ur a knucklehead 
Michael Lu: u knucklehead I might be able to work on baloon brawl later on 
Jeremy Chen: how are we gonna implement usernames on the thing later on today? 
Michael Lu: sure i came home early 
Jeremy Chen: if u add in usernames for anything ill get a var pushed into the other class 
Michael Lu: ok 
Jeremy Chen: i can get the variable into the internal javascript hm idk cuz its hard to do when there is more than one player i guess we could store like player1: player2: in the databse make any random acc login i added some new stuff i dont think the level and xp is formatted well i could change it later 
Michael Lu: wow jermy 
Jeremy Chen: ? 
Michael Lu: id updated the balloon rendering 
Jeremy Chen: ok 
Michael Lu: http://pastebin.com/ZFRDXgM2 should we have them collide? 
Jeremy Chen: sure have them like bounce a little 
Michael Lu: fine 
Jeremy Chen: add some username fields too 
Michael Lu: nah idk 
Jeremy Chen: y 
Michael Lu: wat do you mean? just a space where a name will go? 
Jeremy Chen: yea like above it 
Michael Lu: ok 
Jeremy Chen: just make it write the text above them we need a way to like encrypt our code or something the good thing about php is noone can see it cuz its server side ew what are those it looks so awkward 
Michael Lu: lel we'll just make sprites later don't fret 
Jeremy Chen: and make it purple when it starts the border 
Michael Lu: ok 
Jeremy Chen: i got it but when u send me the next update make sure its purple most of the backend is done i just need to set up game sessions and the leaderboard 
Michael Lu: ok 
Jeremy Chen: the max xp is 250888 and theres 30 lvls it goes up exponentially kind of 
Michael Lu: nevermind collision is too hard 
Jeremy Chen: ok 
Michael Lu: unless you want me to nest for loops and lag the game 
Jeremy Chen: its fine 
Michael Lu: watever ill try for de lelz 
Jeremy Chen: skype? DDDD D 
Michael Lu: can't skype on wekdays I think i got the colllision testing 
Jeremy Chen: wow scrub lollll i guess we should just work on a local mode first for now just make the palyer names like Player 1 and Player 2 actually we could do the username of the guy so for my test like waxman57 and waxman57_Guest if its local i already have a way to get the username from the php for the direction just change it based on the key put a direction constructor and n e s w u should probably change the thing to like right control to inhale and 0 to exhale for player 2 
Michael Lu: why direction? 
Jeremy Chen: so u can see which way they are blowing 
Michael Lu: oh ise 
Jeremy Chen: should we let them blow up? idk to get the username just get document.getElementById("userstore").innerHTML store it in a var and just add _Guest to it for player2 
Michael Lu: YAY i got the collision 
Jeremy Chen: ok 
Michael Lu: and it's really cool 
Jeremy Chen: send me it with the purple border 
Michael Lu: ok are we gonna work on this tomorrow at programmin club? 
Jeremy Chen: idk maybe ill bring my flash drive 
Michael Lu: http://pastebin.com/ktwt7Jpw i don't have a flash drive.. 
Jeremy Chen: ill bring mine just send me a latest version later tonight 
Michael Lu: ok 
Jeremy Chen: and ill put it on there the text is weird it doesnt get centered why dont u just move the text based on the x position of the balloon and add some to the y 
Michael Lu: i know it is a thing with JS canvas text we'll fix it later 
Jeremy Chen: kk 
Michael Lu: idk, we can get the length of the string idk 
Jeremy Chen: and eventually well put an opaque box around it so for now i changed ur code a little bit u should probably update urs too put this in the vars at the top username = document.getElementById("userstore").innerHTML, 
Michael Lu: later 
Jeremy Chen: and put the player1 last constructor as username 
Michael Lu: tomorrow 
Jeremy Chen: and player 2 as username + "_Guest"; i already added it in mine hm theres no way to distinguish between right control and left control 
Michael Lu: wait http://pastebin.com/uxSGMAFK lol AFK 
Jeremy Chen: ? 
Michael Lu: i just updated it so that the ball flies back less if it is larger now what do i do> 
Jeremy Chen: did u add the username and stuff 
Michael Lu: no I'm doing that tomorrow at programming club so you can help me 
Jeremy Chen: i already did it in mine so ill just bring it after i update the one u just sent me 
Michael Lu: ok what else do you want me to do 
Jeremy Chen: um i think u should add the spikes now 
Michael Lu: that's the border 
Jeremy Chen: also 
Michael Lu: the border is a laser 
Jeremy Chen: we need to distinguish a different controls for the player2 cuz space and m is awkward tbh 
Michael Lu: ok what keys 
Jeremy Chen: idk i thought control and 0 but then both control keys work so the other guy could just troll them by holding it down 
Michael Lu: what about 1 and 2 for p1 and 9 and 0 for p2 
Jeremy Chen: idk thats kinda even more awkward for p2 just stick with q and e for p1 
Michael Lu: ok 
Jeremy Chen: i think we should use 0 to exhale p2 and something else for inhale 
Michael Lu: the keys need to be close 
Jeremy Chen: ik 
Michael Lu: o and p? 
Jeremy Chen: but thats so far from arrow keys 
Michael Lu: so is 0 
Jeremy Chen: no numpad 0 
Michael Lu: what if they use numlock/? 
Jeremy Chen: then they r scrub 
Michael Lu: don't use numpad keys 
Jeremy Chen: ok 
Michael Lu: kids confuse them with the regular numbers 
Jeremy Chen: u just added collision right not blowing tho 
Michael Lu: ja 
Jeremy Chen: i think the bounce is a bit much its so troll u dont even have to inhale u just bounce em off 
Michael Lu: ok i decrease 
Jeremy Chen: like if ur tiny u just follow them and bounce them off cuz u move so fast 
Michael Lu: but you'll fly back farrther because you're smaller 
Jeremy Chen: whatever just make it less drastic 
Michael Lu: what are they new p2 keys 
Jeremy Chen: um lets see its kind of unfair to be p2 cuz u have to use 2 hands then i guess um hm this is really weird just test out some keys and see how u like them then just tell me and if we both like it then well go with that also the blue starts way closer to the laser like half way closer ohhh one last thing we need the lives too wait can u send me ur index.html cuz i only have an index.php and it wont work at school unless we have a way to upload it to the server nvm i have it i forgot we have hour of code tho tmrw 
Michael Lu: so 
Jeremy Chen: yea idk did u get any keys figured out maybe . to inhale and / to exhale seems decent 
Michael Lu: <> idk 
Jeremy Chen: ok just pick one ,. or ./ 
Michael Lu: . / 
Jeremy Chen: ./ seems better yea ok just fix the distance on the balloons and put in lives 
Michael Lu: im trying to 
Jeremy Chen: im gonna work on getting email verification 
Michael Lu: but idk the exact distance 
Jeremy Chen: hm do like some midpoint and then add the same number and subtract 
Michael Lu: your relativity makes it really hard 
Jeremy Chen: its fine just find the midpoint and add a relative number just do widfh/2 * (x/16 * num) i mean 
Michael Lu: what is num 
Jeremy Chen: idk anything so for red do width/2 - (x/16 * 2) test out some numbers 
Michael Lu: lemme send you a pastebin hold on 
Jeremy Chen: and for blue do width/2 + (x/16 * 2) ill fix the distances 
Michael Lu: http://pastebin.com/02NbEM9f 
Jeremy Chen: ill do the distances dw 
Michael Lu: imma add the blowing now 
Jeremy Chen: yea lemme do the distances 
Michael Lu: just tell me when you figure them out and make sure that they are actually correct, and distances are equal 
Jeremy Chen: ik i will what does dog do and positionx posX do they even do anything anymore 
Michael Lu: that was a test delete dog 
Jeremy Chen: ok delet positionx and posX too 
Michael Lu: tell me later 
Jeremy Chen: nvm positiony is used 
Michael Lu: wow the direction looks really cool the faster you go the more bent the tail 
Jeremy Chen: k can u send me it again 
Michael Lu: hold on 
Jeremy Chen: ? k i got the positioning 
Michael Lu: http://pastebin.com/nFptFqCi 
Jeremy Chen: use 1.5 and 14.5 aka positionx and positionx+13 
Michael Lu: positionx * 1.5 positionx * 14.5 ? 
Jeremy Chen: no positionx is 1.5 so just use positionx for player one and either 14.5 or positionx +13 
Michael Lu: ok 
Jeremy Chen: the bounce is still a bit too drastic 
Michael Lu: fine 
Jeremy Chen: k well do the blowing tommorow 
Michael Lu: ok 
Jeremy Chen: where do u change it ? also we cant even go on the website at school 
Michael Lu: oh what did i change? 
Jeremy Chen: no where do u change how much it bounces 
Michael Lu: hold on ima send you another update 
Jeremy Chen: k 
Michael Lu: http://pastebin.com/PbUKbsFe 
Jeremy Chen: did u change collision? 
Michael Lu: yea 
Jeremy Chen: k wtf r u keeding me its tiny now u bounce like 1 mm 
Michael Lu: ... fine... 
Jeremy Chen: michael do u even bounce its literally one singular tap on ur movement 
Michael Lu: try 2000 
Jeremy Chen: where 
Michael Lu: 233 and beyond 233-236 
Jeremy Chen: the thing with 5000? 
Michael Lu: yeah only change 5000 to 2000 
Jeremy Chen: k 
Michael Lu: or whatever 
Jeremy Chen: k what was the original 
Michael Lu: 1000 to 5000 1000 you say too much 5000 you say too little 
Jeremy Chen: 1750 too little 
Michael Lu: tell me the number when ur satified 
Jeremy Chen: 1250 perfecto 
Michael Lu: ok 
Jeremy Chen: if theres no other changes other than the 1250 then i guess were done for today 
Michael Lu: hold on lemme finish one thing 
Jeremy Chen: k 
Michael Lu: i just need to render the blowing path 
Jeremy Chen: okkkkkkkkkk just do it as a rectangle for now and more air u have the farther it goes 
Michael Lu: yep yay js accepts negative widths for rectangels we done 
Jeremy Chen: k just send me it 
Michael Lu: lemme send it and you test it 
Jeremy Chen: and ill put it on me flashy drivey k ill put it on the site u test it too just use user: asdf pass: Asdfasdfasdf 
Michael Lu: http://pastebin.com/2SFTYc0n send me da url or whatever 
Jeremy Chen: k hold on tommorow also are we gonna make it be constant based on how much they have at the beginning or gonna have it change constantly the size of the rectangle

Michael Lu: do you want balloon hearts or something? 
Jeremy Chen: idk sure if u can 
Michael Lu: ok btw, pastebin puts in a bunch of random indents, just saying so don't blame me for the lack of conventions 
Jeremy Chen: ok just make it so that once u push the button it releases it all no matter what 
Michael Lu: ... ok, later

Michael Lu: hold on 
Jeremy Chen: wait where are the lives 
Michael Lu: wait until I finish this feature 
Jeremy Chen: nvm i was looking at the wrong class 
Michael Lu: the lives radius is not relative how do I make them relative give me the equation 
Jeremy Chen: i did it already just do (x/16) * .125 for the radius 
Michael Lu: ok ok they're relative now everything, except for the tails 
Jeremy Chen: but also the position of them 
Michael Lu: i did it 
Jeremy Chen: did u make the position relative oh ok good 
Michael Lu: yep

Michael Lu: share it with me 
Jeremy Chen: ok 
Michael Lu: porkythemorky@gmail.com 
Jeremy Chen: k

Michael Lu: no white flash im too lazy 
Jeremy Chen: fine 
Michael Lu: what x and y relative 
Jeremy Chen: but fix the invincibility ill do the lives thing u can get bounced during invincibility and u can die 
Michael Lu: i know 
Jeremy Chen: ok i fixed the lives relativity i added something in the render thats it i put it in the google docs 
Michael Lu: where ok what about the x? 
Jeremy Chen: thats already relative

Michael Lu: germy i have a question 
Jeremy Chen: what 
Michael Lu: when i open an html file does the css have to be in the same folder? bc css isn't loading 
Jeremy Chen: u just have to put the right location 
Michael Lu: what's the right location 
Jeremy Chen: depends wher eu want it to be 
Michael Lu: right now, i have css in a general folder and html in a home page folder home page and general folder are sibling folders 
Jeremy Chen: generl/name.css 
Michael Lu: wut 
Jeremy Chen: general/name.css <link href="general/somecss.css" rel="stylesheet"> 
Michael Lu: i need to put the folder in the src tag? 
Jeremy Chen: yea no its a link to that stylesheet 
Michael Lu: ik but will that work when i load it to github 
Jeremy Chen: just put that in and it will work 
Michael Lu: will the links have to change 
Jeremy Chen: no.. 
Michael Lu: okay cool thx wtf i have to put the entire link? C:\Users\Owner\Documents\GitHub\Littys-Website\General\style.css 
Jeremy Chen: ? no 
Michael Lu: wut 
Jeremy Chen: just general/style.css General/style.css 
Michael Lu: i think you got the slash wrong 
Jeremy Chen: nope <link href="css/custom.css" rel="stylesheet"> thats mine 
Michael Lu: hmm 
Jeremy Chen: oh wait index.html is in its own folder? not the base folder? 
Michael Lu: html is in another folder 
Jeremy Chen: \General/style.css i think maybe ../General/style.css try both idk 
Michael Lu: neh 
Jeremy Chen: just put the htmls in the base folder there is no need to have another folder its so much easier everyone does that 
Michael Lu: base folder? 
Jeremy Chen: so if u have a folder like michaels shit website then inside u have css js and other folder holding ur stuff u just have htmls inside of michaels shit website not a new folder 
Michael Lu: so sort everything based on language? 
Jeremy Chen: then u can easily do css/hi.css 
Michael Lu: oh i see ok cool thx wierd but okay 
Jeremy Chen: its way easier like that because you wont have to route backwards from the folder when doing the html u only need to go forwards into any of the folders 
Michael Lu: k

Jeremy Chen: i have all corner cases 
Michael Lu: Is it just one test case thatâs bad 
Jeremy Chen: yea 
Michael Lu: Move on then come back to it 
Jeremy Chen: no i finished everything else 
Michael Lu: Is it a corner case 
Jeremy Chen: i dont think so 
Michael Lu: Do they provide the right answer? 
Jeremy Chen: im p sure i handled all corner cases no its hidden and i tested my code on the leetcode version 
Michael Lu: Try running ur own custom cases They shld tell u the expected answer 
Jeremy Chen: ik 
Michael Lu: And if ur answer is diff 
Jeremy Chen: but i cant think of a corner that i havent covered they also dont tell answer its hidden 
Michael Lu: Oh shit Is it something with rounding errors in Java 
Jeremy Chen: should i put a comment that it might be wrong or is that gonna sound like an excuse might be rounding error theres no way for me to fix it tho cuz i dont know what the input is or the output and how it gets rounded 
Michael Lu: If itâs the exact same problem Maybe debug it in leet code idk Hacker rank is bad at debugging 
Jeremy Chen: nah my leetcode went through 
Michael Lu: Hmmm 
Jeremy Chen: i have 9 mins left im just gonna put a comment saying it might be wrong 
Michael Lu: Whatâs the input for the test case 
Jeremy Chen: or does that sound like im making excuses nothing its hidden all hidden 
Michael Lu: Fuck just think abt it then Donât comment They usually donât check ur code 
Jeremy Chen: ok 
Michael Lu: Just spend that time looking over ur code But if u passed everything but one I think ur in good shape still 
Jeremy Chen: the only reason i think its wrong is because its not a hard question and there arent even many corner cases that i can think of 
Michael Lu: Think of more lol? 
Jeremy Chen: there are no more rounding error or wrong case 2 mins left w/e

Conversation:
Michael Lu: Heelo I am your Scioly Astronomy partner. halp wat do i study 
Jessica Jiang: lol hi Uhh I did Astro last yr and got first plc with my partner but I advise u to check out an Astro textbook from DR t And start reading it and looking at th spec sheet I can share u my Astro rev sheet that I made if u want 
Michael Lu: can you? thx :) 
Jessica Jiang: lol wait whats your name? sorry didnt check the events list thoroughly and im pretty sure ur name isnt litty LOL 
Michael Lu: lel Michael Lu do they change the astronomy topics every year 
Jessica Jiang: yeah basically 
Michael Lu: or is it always related to stellar evolution? oh 
Jessica Jiang: lol i didnt start studying for scioly at all yet and probably wont start for a while so i am sorry but i promise i will and just check out the spec sheet and search up the dso's 
Michael Lu: lol ur probably gonna be carrying this year no idea wat im doing XDXDXD 
Jessica Jiang: omg legit last yr no one in the room knew what to do like my partner and i got first and we left like 5 blank cuz its a lot of math and no mult choice 
Michael Lu: oh 
Jessica Jiang: and some ppl in the room during the test just gave up and sat there 
Michael Lu: ho ho ho don't we get to bring some reference stuffs? 
Jessica Jiang: laptop and/or binder i suggest laptop bc u can download the textbook lmao and use search 
Michael Lu: O_o 
Jessica Jiang: but no wifi 
Michael Lu: woah oh.. so we can reference the review sheets during the competition? 
Jessica Jiang: yup! bc astro is one of the hardest events imo 
Michael Lu: :| crap lol 
Jessica Jiang: ITS OK IDRC IF I PLACE IN ASTRO THIS YEAR LOL like hopefully we do but eh lets just try our best 
Michael Lu: who was ur partner last year? 
Jessica Jiang: victoria tsao, she graduated and is attending upenn rn tbh she didnt rly study until the day before lol but she had the textbook so it helped a lot 
Michael Lu: oke 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Where can I download the textbook? What is the name of the textbook? 
Jessica Jiang: Just ask DR t to check out an astronomy textbook from school 
Michael Lu: ok 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: which parts do I read? All of it? 
Jessica Jiang: First understand the basics but then focus on this years specific topic which is type 1a supernovas Also learn the DSOs which are listed on 3c of the astronomy spec sheet make sure to look at the spec sheet too LOL and understand the math stuff Cuz last year's test was basically all math 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Are the review sheets based off of last year's topics? 
Jessica Jiang: not really Just general knowledge and some of last year's DSOs 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: wat do I read in textbook? 
Jessica Jiang: read the parts relevant to the spec sheet and basically spend more time on the bolded words especially type 1a supernovae Sorry I'm taking a practice sat rn. I'll explain more and we can plan what to study later 
Michael Lu: k 


Conversation:
Jessica Jiang: aight sorry for getting back to you so late but i think its best if we just divide the workload and studying cuz literally all teams won't even get a near perf score, and last yr some teams just sat there and did nothing also the textbook doesnt  prepare you for the exam but it helps to understand the basics 
Michael Lu: k 
Jessica Jiang: wait jk last yr my partner downloaded the textbook onto her laptop and we were allowed to use it, and that helped w the DSOs 
Michael Lu: lol 
Jessica Jiang: also dont study part 2 of the textbook cuz its just about our solar system but check out ch 14 and 15 of it read part 3 (dw im reading it too) 


Conversation:
Jessica Jiang: thanks for sharing the notes 
Michael Lu: np 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: How many equations did you use from the formula sheet on astronomy tests? 
Jessica Jiang: I forgot but I remember that I used them and basically just plugged them in bc I had the formula sheet 
Michael Lu: Is the test designed that you can't just plug in and play? Any unit conversions? 
Jessica Jiang: not last yr I'm not too sure about this yr so I'll ask Allan tmr and get back to u 
Michael Lu: Is there gonna be a lot of binary system math this year? 
Jessica Jiang: y r u asking me questions that I possible couldn't know without taking the test LOL 
Michael Lu: Idk don't you have the content sheet? 
Jessica Jiang: I mean I'm kinda studying for ap bio right now 
Michael Lu: K sry Ttyl Btw can u check the DSO sheet later Thx 


Conversation:
Jessica Jiang: sorry i didn't check it yet bc every week in junior year is hell week, but i promise that i'll devote all of tmr to astronomy 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: How do you download the textbook? 
Jessica Jiang: idk; honestly just copy and paste everything onto a doc so u can use the search command 
Michael Lu: Can we take a practice test sometime Thursday? 
Jessica Jiang: sure but I'll also be practicing widi 
Michael Lu: K Can u add escape velocity to formula sheet? 
Jessica Jiang: ok ill do that later btw do u have any notes for dwarf novas, am cvn, mira variable stars? 
Michael Lu: Err, not rlly I can make some 
Jessica Jiang: thanks bc they're bolded so it's important 
Michael Lu: Can I make them tmrw? 
Jessica Jiang: yeah sure can u add it onto the spec sheet i made so everything can be more coherent and organized also feel free to add info 
Michael Lu: K 
Jessica Jiang: hey so allan sent me 2 textbooks, but they're not the one from school that dr t gives us (astronomy today) i cant open one of the textbooks but it's fine bc he said that one has harder stuff we dont needa know 
Michael Lu: What's the real test like compared to today's practice test? Also when they ask about DSOs, do they ever ask trivial obscure historical things, or do they just focus on the science? Since my laptop battery life is 20 min I might bring binder instead... 
Jessica Jiang: omg no bring ur laptop Is there another laptop you can use? 
Michael Lu: I can try 
Jessica Jiang: Like a parents? uhh as for DSOs they didn't last yr but I guess it wouldn't hurt adding those things And real test wouldn't have that many mult choice Also there would be a packet of dsos and the test would say to look at the packet So there would be like 20 q on a page instead of like five 
Michael Lu: Will questions be concept based still? Instead of all math 
Jessica Jiang: not that I recall all I remember last yr was me and my partner freaking out and everyone else in the room giving up, and A team sighing and being distressed 
Michael Lu: No outlets in rooms? :/ 
Jessica Jiang: I suggest u email dr t and see Cuz we won't necessarily be assigned near a plug 
Michael Lu: Are we assigned seats? 
Jessica Jiang: Yes Do u hav other laptops at home that u can use 
Michael Lu: I can ask tmrw 
Jessica Jiang: kk pls lemme KNO bc I might be able to let u borrow one of my old ones but it's kinda slow but only if u don't have others bc it's like ten extra pounds 
Michael Lu: K Also spec sheet additions should be done K thx I can use my dads laptop btw 
Jessica Jiang: yoo did u see the post melody made Astronomy 3.c. Henize 2-248 should be Henize 2-428 (10/9/16) oh jk just checked the doc and u did it correctly 
Michael Lu: err, did you update any of the notes u sent me a while back? 
Jessica Jiang: No I've only worked only the rev sheet I mean rev packet 
Michael Lu: k 
Jessica Jiang: i updated the formula sheet

Jianna Liu: wait ive always done it separately hmm let me ask my secret weapon jamie um Iâm not sure that makes sense let me ask Jason Ok wait that makes more sense Basically I think you just compile the react code and then serve regular html/css/js from flask thatâs the command I think you can specify the output directory with -C i think thats to point to the folder https://github.com/techx/spectacle/blob/master/server/__init__.py#L46 and thats to serve it 
Michael Lu: :o f 
Jianna Liu: F Think Ur not A part of Spectacle yet So you canât access 
Michael Lu: *hackMIT yet* ** 
Jianna Liu: Soon 
Michael Lu: lol aight thazzzz tuff

Joelle Siong Sin: "Scene 1
Camera pans over serene Long Island suburbs in September.

Further south of our main town, Great Neck, lies Great Neck South High School and the town of New Hyde Park.

Follows a bus moving down a street in New Hyde Park.
Cue opening theme: âIQ: 147â

Nestled in between two underclassmen (a boy and a girl)is our protagonist, Caleb Hao. He stands out with his slicked black hair and tailored shirt. Sitting with the self-assured grace of a true visionary, a dreamer, he turns to the students fortunate enough to be next to him.

Caleb: Hey, do you know a bit about quantum physics? My Feinstein internship allowed me to uncover the secrets of our universe by curing cancer with multi-moded genetic modeling. 

Boy: Ok? Whatâs that mean?

Caleb: I donât have time to work with disabled people during the school year. I have a summer internship for that. 

Girl: Well, you seem to be a smart guy!

Caleb: Yep, my IQ is 147! And if I wasnât a narcissist, Iâd be perfect.

Begin vocal musical number (âIQ: 147â).

Caleb
Ladies, Iâd like to introduce myself now,
Hi, fellow citizens, my nameâs Caleb Hao!
My humble origins are not to be scorned,
âCause I started AP Chemistry the day I was born.

Girl
Well there Caleb, you sure seem quite smart.

Caleb
Sure thing, my IQ is way off of the charts.

Chorus (Caleb and underclassmen)
His nameâs Caleb Hao,
And donât feel so blue,
Since he knows so damn much,
And heâs smarter than you!
Been acing the sciences since the age of eleven,
Heâs perfect, stupendous, IQ 147!
" omfg can I post this or is it too harsh

Joelle Siong Sin: "tbh this is just a sad page where the mods add both pathetic confessions that contribute to the shitty GNS community and confessions that say shit like âoh why is it this wayâ. you know why itâs like this? because you mods propagate âconfessionsâ that actively stir up trouble just to seem like people are engaging the community. if youâre going to be a place for everybody to spit out their thoughts, then quit modding and post whatever degenerate thoughts come from this community. if youâre going to encourage HEALTHY discussion, start by actually using your judgement when it comes to what you post. this page has gone to shit and it doesnât affect me since i can unfollow yâall, but if you guys are going to serve as a bridge between the sad souls of GNS, TRY TO SET A BETTER FUCKING EXAMPLE.

âno hurtful or threatening commentsâ my ass. you guys post some of the shittiest stuff out there. at this point, this page shouldnât even exist. quit indulging in drama and maybe try to make the school at least seem like a better place." LOL oh my

Joelle Siong Sin: I have to do RD 
Michael Lu: Lollll I had to do RD last year too EA is pretty big mÃªme Donât worry too much abt it I felt pretty shit abt getting rejected from Stanford REA and then seeing Ethan Get In (because I was a little bitch back then) 
Joelle Siong Sin: I am worrying A lot ð 
Michael Lu: Thatâs completely normal I felt like genuine shit last year I was literally submitting apps hours after the deadline Because I didnât have my shit together Ur not alone And like, ur not less worth than anybody at GNS for not getting into ur early 
Joelle Siong Sin: LOLL DID THEY STILL ACCEPT THE APP 
Michael Lu: Yeah lol my MIT app was submitted 3 hrs late 
Joelle Siong Sin: ð¤­ Bxheksjdjd me rn 
Michael Lu: Yeah itâll pass Like tbh I talk to my friends at stony brook a lot And Iâve realized that after senior year of college Nobody really cares what school you go to and the college environment across the country is basically homogenous People care more about how smart you actually are And ur a fucking genius Joelle So ur in good shape Also since ur like one of the few non toxic and wholesome people in ur grade If u want my essays or essay help or something lmk 
Joelle Siong Sin: LOL ty:( 
Michael Lu: Or ask Jen Wang idk 
Joelle Siong Sin: V true but like rn hdjsjdjdjs thereâs so much PRESSURE I asked jen and I think she forgot to send them and I feel bad about asking again HAHA 
Michael Lu: Yeah NGL the first half of senior year sucks 
Joelle Siong Sin: But I definitely feel like I wasted my early 
Michael Lu: Was it an RRR WAS REA 
Joelle Siong Sin: I shouldâve done a school where early wouldâve made a bigger difference lol Uhh it was stanford 
Michael Lu: Eyyyyyyy Ma man!!! 
Joelle Siong Sin: But I told like 3 people so ð¤« But yeah did not go well ð 
Michael Lu: Lmao yeah i definitely feel what u mean Yeah getting rejected from Stanford was shitty But like give it sometime and wherever u end up You wonât give a second look back at Stanford Also theyâre like College scandalous and shit and legacy 
Joelle Siong Sin: LOLL

Joelle Siong Sin: Sorry abt the hackathon loll 
Michael Lu: Oh yeah I appreciate that ur very low key abt this college stuff College apps brings out the best and worst of ppl And I feel like youâd be pretty humble 
Joelle Siong Sin: Lol no one currently at south knows where I earlied 
Michael Lu: Which I appreciate so ð 
Joelle Siong Sin: Besides Dana, Drt and ko 
Michael Lu: Yeah keep all ur shit on the DL and donât compare urself to other ppl because it just becomes toxic And donât flex ðª

Joelle Siong Sin: Yeah But rn it feels like Iâm the only one that has to RD even tho thatâs not actually true But sjdjdkkdckxkos

Michael Lu: yeah watup 
Joelle Siong Sin: Why do you even have an email trackerð  And whyâd you submit two different personal essays to different schools loll 
Michael Lu: 1. got an email tracker to see how many job recruiters were ghosting my emails 2. so the firefighting essay was actually not supposed to be my main essay lol it was one of my MIT essays and then was expanded to a Princeton long essay and then i was like "damn this is not a bad common app essay" Those two essays emphasize different qualities of me, so I swapped them out for different schools, based on each school's culture, to appear as a better "cultural fit" def don't need to do that, most ppl just use one essay 
Joelle Siong Sin: Ohh okay makes sense Lol I rewrote mine in November after Stanford bc it was bad Stop tracking my clicks ð¤ð¤

John Mannooparambil: Lmao what happened Also yeah we both needed to grow bigger balls 
Michael Lu: Well for me it was following the bro code But then I realized deep is not a bro 
John Mannooparambil: Hmm smart man Surprised an mit kid didnât figure that out earlier 
Michael Lu: I was trying to be open minded 
John Mannooparambil: I understand What was wrong about Kathleen though 
Michael Lu: Oh nothing much She just doesnât have as much pizazz as Sharonâs 
John Mannooparambil: Lmao a showman as well?!?! Actually that does fit u 
Michael Lu: Katherine is mild SharoÃ± is spicy 
John Mannooparambil: Yeah I understand I also have regrets Definitely wished I had dropped Miriam 
Michael Lu: Yes i could understand that Lol 
John Mannooparambil: Lmao even neves came up to me during prom âI knew they would hang out but I was not expecting thisâ Yeah prom was a big rip for me 
Michael Lu: Lol 
John Mannooparambil: But like honestly it was to the point where I just acted as if Miriam wasnât my date Lmao I wasnât even going to tell her I planned on ditching until saad told me to tell her 
Michael Lu: Wait lowkey same vibes over here It is what it is 
John Mannooparambil: Ohh really? Welcome to the club Lmao and then Erick was acting so stupid 
Michael Lu: Why 
John Mannooparambil: Did u get exposed by him 
Michael Lu: XD 
John Mannooparambil: When we were on line for the photo booth we split into two groups right at first 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
John Mannooparambil: And then Erick was like John should u go in with ur prom date And then I have to turn his head 180 degreees backwards to Miriam and Aaron just holding each other 
Michael Lu: Dam 
John Mannooparambil: Boi 
Michael Lu: Big ass rip 
John Mannooparambil: How was ur table 
Michael Lu: Idk tbh I tried to spend as little time as possible there 
John Mannooparambil: I should have done that I got an even bigger rip there U know who I was sitting with right 
Michael Lu: Who Deep? 
John Mannooparambil: No They were all Miriamâs friends Jana 
Michael Lu: Oh lol Shit Sherlock 
John Mannooparambil: Arya Kaitlin Not Kaitlin 
Michael Lu: White 
John Mannooparambil: Kaytlyn Michelle Dong lee Those people right Jaymin 
Michael Lu: Yup 
John Mannooparambil: Anyways when we(more like I) walk into the room I start looking for my table It takes me like a min but I find it And pretty much all her friends are already sitting down So I donât really like her friends but I donât really care tbh 
Michael Lu: Yeah yeah 
John Mannooparambil: I agreed to sit with them bc I thought Miriam would be with me at least 
Michael Lu: Lol was she 
John Mannooparambil: So i donât want to go over there and just sit down by myself They donât know me and that would be pretty weird Theyâd be confused as why I was there or it would be off So anyways I look to find Miriam so I could go sit with her But I canât find her So Iâm there pretending to not know where my table is looking for Miriam And itâs super awake for me bc Iâm just wandering around like an idiot And then I realize sheâs probably with Aaron 
Michael Lu: Lol whatâd u do the entire time? 
John Mannooparambil: The entire time at prom? 
Michael Lu: At the table 
John Mannooparambil: Ok so basically I had to then go find ashwin bc heâs the only other person Ik at the table 
Michael Lu: Dam 
John Mannooparambil: And ashwin is fine but do I really want to spend my entire time tasing to ashwin 
Michael Lu: Lol yeah true 
John Mannooparambil: Yeah so got screwed there as well Completely regret prom though Should have just came for photos and left

Conversation:
John Mannooparambil: Hey Send my your workout routine 
Michael Lu: Why U pumping iron at u much Umich 
John Mannooparambil: Lmao yeah I just got out of the gym 
Michael Lu: R u going for size lol And also how experienced r u (in years) 
John Mannooparambil: Lol ig Iâve worked out with jeerhti for like a year ish Keerthi 
Michael Lu: Did it work 
John Mannooparambil: Like I would do it for like a month or two at a time And hen get lazy and not go 
Michael Lu: Oh lol Ok well anyways 
John Mannooparambil: But thatâs was Bc the gym was far away Now the gym in right next to my dorm 
Michael Lu: Workout every other day (abt three times a week) For beginners like u and me Use mostly compound full body lifts So for me that was: A) Legs: squat, deadlift, or weighted lunges 
A) Calves: weighted calve raises 

B ) Chest: bench press, dumbbell flyes, or dips 
B ) Back: barbell rows

C) shoulders: shoulder press or lateral raises
C) back again: shit ton of (weighted) pull ups

D) biceps (if ur a fucking scrub): hammer curls, plate curl, or chin-ups
D) triceps: triceps pull down, weighted military push ups, clap pushups, or weighted diamond pushups
D) abs: marine corps crunches, some abs supersets, planks, or leg raises (go find abs workouts online) On days where Iâd have time Iâd hit Sections A to D, and superset the exercises within a section ex. One set bench, one set row, another set bench, another set row etc If ur pressed for time, cut out section D because full body workouts in other sections should hit those muscle groups already Also did some dumbbell forearm raises in Section D forgot to add that Do four sets per muscle group, 12 reps to 8 reps, increasing weight Pick and choose one exercise for each muscle group under each section,
So on mondays Iâd do
Squat, calve, raises, bench, row, shoulder press, pull-ups, plate curls, weighted push ups, marine corps crunches Should be done in less than two hours honestly if not then cut some shit out or just workout faster Most important notes:
- be consistent donât get fucking lazy and cheat itself, go every other day for a few months
- sleep 7 - 8 hrs ideally
- u wonât make any progress without eating a lot, when I started out I had 4 meals a day, followed every workout with chipotle burrito bowl. Aim for 3000+ calories Also weigh urself,m every week, I gained 15+ lbs in three months And then I started doing cardio for bootcamp (avoid cardio lol pls) Also look into cutting after you bulk for a few months I started out skinny as fuck so I didnât have to worry abt that lol But idk 
John Mannooparambil: Alright gotcha this is going to take me a bit to read through and fully understand but thank you Iâm trying to actually get fit in college Not that freshman 15

Conversation:
Michael Lu: I was now but a little young boyâjust a couple billion years old. One day, I was playing with a little blue ball that I had made. It must have gotten a little dusty, because everytime I slapped the ball, it shed a layer of gray-colored particulate. One time, I slapped my ball so hard that a huge cloud of dust formed. I had no choice but to suck it up, so I did just that. Unfortunately, this caused me to sneeze on my poor little ball. After the great sneeze, I noticed some green blobs on my ball. I watched the ball for a couple billion years and noticed that the blobs started to change colors and got populated with little beings. I guess that's how I made the Earth... what do u think abt this story do u think it's weird or normal

Jonathan Neves: Interesting seems a lil biased. There are some interesting points made 
Michael Lu: author from Columbia and reminds me of my sister I think they're reading too far into Yang's words 
Jonathan Neves: They bash yang with subtle references of how's he good as to seem as unbiased or what not 
Michael Lu: Well this is supposed to be biased It's basically an opinion piece 
Jonathan Neves: Well yes I think they read into some things he said too much 
Michael Lu: it is* Lol u as a fellow asian american 1/5* asian american 
Jonathan Neves: Sure sure Im not supposed to show my americaness 
Michael Lu: lol americaness isn't rlly a strong concept tho at least in how Yang defines it unsure as to what it means 
Jonathan Neves: Americaness is rooted in diversity I assume he means standard outside world looking into US 
Michael Lu: but doesn't mean Yang is necessarily appeasing to "white ppl" lol what does the world thing American culture is 
Jonathan Neves: Couldn't really say. I guess it's sort of saying don't do outwardly non American cultural things? What yang says is a viable strategy. If you take it to far then it is appeasing white ppl, but that's not exactly what he's saying to do 
Michael Lu: I mean I feel like in these times Thereâs no way to rlly combat Asian racism By proving americanness Unless U like vocally shit on the Chinese gov In general tho 
Jonathan Neves: It's a little step, but people will be still be racist in these troubling times People want a scapegoat 
Michael Lu: Troo I think the scope of this article and the circumstances of the issue make constrain the real interesting social problem from being discussed Coupled by the fact that both Yangâs words and the authors words are meh The real social problem being, to what extent should we celebrate/protect diversity and applaud/advocate assimilation? Like was the Meiji reformation a shameful thing for Japan to do if it gave them a powerful foothold in world politics, which was back then dominated by the West? And given that the current status quo has changed to appreciate diversity, to what extent should we advocate for racial minorities to assimilate into the âwhiter/western qualitiesâ of American society? 
Jonathan Neves: It's the real question that needs to be solved. People don't want their culture and personal individuality destroyed by total assimilation, but on the other hand if total diversity is introduced, then Americans might feel their culture being eroded and mixed with the influx of diversity.( A difficult thing because American culture is poorly defined and I think it's more regional than national). The discussion is how to find that special spot while making every group happy As you said, look at history. Most people would say Japan was better off during Meiji than Tokugawa. America through history has always went against a group that seemed to perceive  as a threat. African Americans, the Irish precivil war, WW2 Japanese, and now Asians during this crisis. So like you said, how does a nation balance diversity/assimilation especially during a crisis 
Michael Lu: good poin 
Jonathan Neves: Do you have an extra breadboard? 
Michael Lu: R u asking for them? 
Jonathan Neves: I'm asking because I need a breadboard to do science labs 
Michael Lu: I do but how would I get it to you Also u donât rlly need a breadboard

Michael Lu: Why did they not give breadboards 
Jonathan Neves: AHAHa 
Michael Lu: To u 
Jonathan Neves: They do But keerthi loaned out the given one and then I used my mec one and that's disappeared Working with capacitors would be a pain in the ass w/o a bb

Michael Lu: What do u think the word de-hat means Nvm 
Jonathan Neves: To Remove a hat, but disregard what I said 
Michael Lu: Good answer 
Jonathan Neves: If you were stranded with only two worms and an apple, what would be your food strategy to live the longest? Sorry, I typed this message in the wrong chat. 
Michael Lu: Plant apple seeds Cut worms in half And then they eat apple What is the correct answer sir 
Jonathan Neves: There's no right answer, but clearly the right answer is feed the apple to the worms to get stronger worms and slowly gnaw on the more powerful and caloric worms. There's no time for seeds. 
Michael Lu: Youâre right If you cut the worms in half Wonât both haves grow independently 
Jonathan Neves: Something like that and if you feed the apple, you have better worms 
Michael Lu: Where did u find this question Lmao Why* As well 
Jonathan Neves: Does it matter if it stimulates the brain 
Michael Lu: Umm Haha I guess not But what if I asked u 
Jonathan Neves: These are the questions that raise the standard of the next generation 
Michael Lu: Lol idk what to ask U know U asked this question right when Iâm watching Primitive Technology 
Jonathan Neves: Wow. How on brand 
Michael Lu: And rn he is making a trap For prawns 
Jonathan Neves: Prawns. Surviving like a gentleman 
Michael Lu: Wow I just watched him kill them F 
Jonathan Neves: Well. Don't let me distract you from primative technology. Enjoy the videos 
Michael Lu: Lol u should watch primitive tech Also have u done any recent projects I sent 
Jonathan Neves: Well. Not as much. Right now I'm in finals. If you're asking why I didn't get there before, well, there should be a good reason why I completed my first final today 
Michael Lu: Congratulations ð¾ðð 
Jonathan Neves: Possible 100 Not a flex 
Michael Lu: Def a flex ðª 
Jonathan Neves: Well My midterm 1 and 2 were also 100 
Michael Lu: I can feel ur biceps coming out of the screen and poking my eyes 
Jonathan Neves: So not a flex 
Michael Lu: Oh my Am starting to feel claustrophobic Ur flexing muscles are taking up too much room ðª 
Jonathan Neves: If that's the case for me, I would be long dead because of you due to lack of oxygen Let me show you the stats for midterm 2 
Michael Lu: Ok yes sir Wow those r good grades What class is this 
Jonathan Neves: Linear algebra 
Michael Lu: Oh boy oh boy I dropped my linear algebra U are very big boy 
Jonathan Neves: Oh boy oh boy Cutthroat at the MITs Flex McGee dropped the class 
Michael Lu: Yes the professor was terrible He wrote a math programming language called Julia And so then 
Jonathan Neves: Stop already terrible 
Michael Lu: The class often was taught in Julia Was it The JUIA JULIA 
Jonathan Neves: My school had the guy who made the textbook But it was free, so no problem 
Michael Lu: Wowiwowowoow Is he the famous math finance guy 
Jonathan Neves: Don't think so, but he is a man of the people He got the university to move back the date where we can set if a class if graded or pass/incomplete 
Michael Lu: Wow wow Absolute legend Unlike Saadâs programming professor apparently 
Jonathan Neves: I though saads teachers were ok 
Michael Lu: Do u guys share classes 
Jonathan Neves: We will next semester 
Michael Lu: If there is one 
Jonathan Neves: I mean there will be. The q is if it's real or virtual 
Michael Lu: Prob virtual Or maybe not Idk 
Jonathan Neves: Who knows. I don't really have a preference 
Michael Lu: Rlly Donât u miss the boyz 
Jonathan Neves: Well Wonji is probably yeeting away, most likely 
Michael Lu: Yes I heard 
Jonathan Neves: And I'm not sharing a space with the other boys So I would be alone(r) 
Michael Lu: Hmm U should join a club Or be friends with ur favorite Eric Wang 
Jonathan Neves: The Stony clubs are not good Why would I be friends with bongos 
Michael Lu: Bongos? 
Jonathan Neves: Which Eric Wang are you referring too 
Michael Lu: How many are there? 
Jonathan Neves: I only know 1 
Michael Lu: I only know 1 
Jonathan Neves: Motch gave him a nickname like bongos but I can't remember it fully 
Michael Lu: Haha wut Bad nickname But he is coming to stony brook 
Jonathan Neves: It was a while. Like mabongo or something. At Mongolian bbq Is he? 
Michael Lu: And u already know he was poppin off with EECS questions during the 2638 alumni thingy 
Jonathan Neves: Oh god 
Michael Lu: YUVEYUVEYUVEYUVEYUVE 
Jonathan Neves: Well. I wouldn't see him anyway 
Michael Lu: Y 
Jonathan Neves: I would share no classes with him 
Michael Lu: But what if he 
Jonathan Neves: And if he does electrical or comsci, there will be little chance for interaction 
Michael Lu: Wicked smaht 
Jonathan Neves: So He would skipped straight to differential equations 
Michael Lu: O lol dÃ©finit le not 
Jonathan Neves: So no way it's happening Anyways, my mom is trying to get me to transfer and I've thought about it, so If I did, no ewang 
Michael Lu: So transfer after sophomore yeR? 
Jonathan Neves: Either spring soph or fall junior 
Michael Lu: Interesting I mean Aaron said because a lot of kids at stony Commute Is very dead So makes sense 
Jonathan Neves: That's one of the reason. Stonybrook is just like dead and boring I went out of my way to do some things which eventually we're bad and ended up having too much free time 
Michael Lu: Like wut robotics club? 
Jonathan Neves: Yea 
Michael Lu: F 
Jonathan Neves: Nothing against Saad. But if he is the VP for a club at sophomore year, something occuring at that club 
Michael Lu: Lmao yeah he said it was weird how it happened 
Jonathan Neves: The club is run by sophomores mostly But I don't know where I would theoretically transfer to 
Michael Lu: Aaron did NYU and BU And some others But I think he got into those 
Jonathan Neves: I know where he applied 
Michael Lu: O 
Jonathan Neves: But he is also focusing on comsci As well as mech Now there might be some crossover, but I would need good engineering school in good engineering places 
Michael Lu: NYU tandon? Pittsburg? Carnegie According to Perlman Itâs gotta be ABET accredited 
Jonathan Neves: Is NYC known for its great engineering jobs I know that 
Michael Lu: NYC has jobs Good and bad Well maybe not currently lol 
Jonathan Neves: Well I have to do the research 
Michael Lu: Yah U have plenty of time 
Jonathan Neves: I just need a more active school than Stony. It has little opportunity for engineering But I don't know how stupid I am and if I could succeed at these better programs but that's probably nerves 
Michael Lu: Have u talked to any alum 
Jonathan Neves: No because I'm not connected like you and Im not even sure about transferring yet Like the name recognition and aura surrounding a Carnegie is enough to make me think I'll get destroyed at school but idk 
Michael Lu: I guess u gotta research 
Jonathan Neves: I guess I do But after fun multivariable calc final 
Michael Lu: Yes sir get 100% 
Jonathan Neves: Well seeing on the last test that my ~70 was like an A, I don't see a 100% in my future 
Michael Lu: Just get a 80 â> 100 
Jonathan Neves: I'm technically taking two tests since I have to also remake the first test I missed Uh the class grades depend on everybody else. On the last test, people have a 50, were on track to get a solid B 
Michael Lu: Oh lmao rlly F Well Iâm sure u shall ðª 
Jonathan Neves: ITS TOMORROW lolol. The 14th Well. Time for me to continue studying. Bon vivant 
Michael Lu: Yes sir yes sir Good luck

Jonathan Neves: I need a big brain with big brain energy. Can you help? 
Michael Lu: Hello Whatâs up 
Jonathan Neves: I haveth no idea what part a is asking me to do 
Michael Lu: What class is this Matlav? 
Jonathan Neves: The glorious coding with matlab Yes 
Michael Lu: Lmao So when u go to the data I think it wants you to pick 
Jonathan Neves: That assignment is worth 40% of my grade 
Michael Lu: Which variables 
Jonathan Neves: I have the data and picked out variables mhm continue 
Michael Lu: Wait they tell u what x and y are right Daily fatalities or something 
Jonathan Neves: Yea 
Michael Lu: I think u just guess a and b or a, b, c To make best fit curve MatLab prob has a best fit thingy right 
Jonathan Neves: Yeah it does 
Michael Lu: Yeah so just pick option 1 Because less parameters just a and b it seems 
Jonathan Neves: And make one variable a and the other b 
Michael Lu: Yeah those are like parameters that shape your curve And so u need to find those values with some regression thingy in Matlab To minimize RMSE? Actually do it for both curves Options 
Jonathan Neves: I guess so 
Michael Lu: And i think you chose whichever one gives less RMSE 
Jonathan Neves: I only have two variables though 
Michael Lu: Wdym 
Jonathan Neves: Option 2 has a,b,c 
Michael Lu: Yes Well Your data is x and y 
Jonathan Neves: Oh It's gonna calculate those variables? 
Michael Lu: a, b, and c are just constants that change the shape of ur regression curve, provides in options 1 and 2 X and Y should be provided by the website I guess 
Jonathan Neves: I calculated those but yes.i have what I'll need 
Michael Lu: Like daily fatalities vs positive test cases 
Jonathan Neves: I see 
Michael Lu: Do u know what ur graphing I.e. do u know what X and Y are 
Jonathan Neves: Part 2 says analyzed data vs day number But x and y are probably daily fatalities vs reported positive cases 
Michael Lu: Ok cool So plot x and y Then I think you wanna do a regression using the curves of option 1 and option 2 And Matlab should automatically find the constants a and b for option 1 and a, b, c for option 2 to yield the least RMSE Hopefully If not use desmos idk Lol 
Jonathan Neves: I would hope so Thank you for aiding my comprehension of the question 
Michael Lu: Iâd double check with one of ur classmates They prob know more about the assignment than me 
Jonathan Neves: They have not started, but I'm planning too 
Michael Lu: Lol Good boy Or Wait for them to start And watch killer bean 
Jonathan Neves: Ok I might

Jonathan Neves: No. Not from South Park 
Michael Lu: Ok R u like A satanist or something 
Jonathan Neves: No I'm mot I could ask you how you know about cthulu 
Michael Lu: South Park u dingi Do u play love craft? 
Jonathan Neves: No I dont You could guess, but I don't think you would guess 
Michael Lu: Fuck Bird box Call of cthulu World of Warcraft Terraria 
Jonathan Neves: No lol 
Michael Lu: The 2010 Polish presidential election 
Jonathan Neves: what the heck now 
Michael Lu: Look it up 
Jonathan Neves: why they talking about cthulu in poland I see Seems like you are an avid cthulu fan 
Michael Lu: Bro No Iâm not U are U knew about him first 
Jonathan Neves: Mmm so that's how that works does it 
Michael Lu: Srsly how u know 
Jonathan Neves: How do I know most of the things that I do. I just do 
Michael Lu: Ok Whatever helps u sleep better at night ^overcompensating 
Jonathan Neves: almost like your muscles 
Michael Lu: O 
Jonathan Neves: Overcompensating for something 
Michael Lu: Speaking of Very funny 
Jonathan Neves: Okey 
Michael Lu: O my Heâs back 
Jonathan Neves: did he ever leave or are you just reintroducing him 
Michael Lu: Yeah bro he goes to UBC Youâd know if u were a true Trevan Lam fan 
Jonathan Neves: i never claimed to be 
Michael Lu: Sure sure sure 
Jonathan Neves: now i have to look up what ubc stands for 
Michael Lu: Ur big cock 
Jonathan Neves: hahaha howd you know 
Michael Lu: ð 
Jonathan Neves: he goes to school in canada ? 
Michael Lu: I guess lol 
Jonathan Neves: Vancouver is nice. Less littys flexing over there 
Michael Lu: Lmao bro watchusayin 
Jonathan Neves: you flex on bcho in boston, so parkour trevan is safe from you 
Michael Lu: Wut 
Jonathan Neves: exactly 
Michael Lu: I donât even interact with bcho 
Jonathan Neves: all makes sense 
Michael Lu: Bold of u to assume that 
Jonathan Neves: you and bcho with the hot chocalate 
Michael Lu: Lol wuttttt explain ?? 
Jonathan Neves: now you get to flex all over wonjihyung when he goes to boston its terrifying a spooky scary skexperience 
Michael Lu: Brrreeo Lol 
Jonathan Neves: ill have to warn wonjihyung about the lack of breathable air in boston because your muscle cells steal all the precious O2 and cause climate change 
Michael Lu: Bro lmao U funny boi U v funny 
Jonathan Neves: its interesting that you find the truth funny 
Michael Lu: Who said ââtwas truth Also ur so yâall That u prob steal all the oxygen for ur growth too 
Jonathan Neves: no height is slowly and not intensive. literally ripping iron like you is intensive and wastes tons of oxygen 
Michael Lu: Omg u try too hard 
Jonathan Neves: want more proof definitive hands down proof 
Michael Lu: Bro lmao I was a smol junior back then 
Jonathan Neves: if you used that much oxyg back then, its really scary to think about now 
Michael Lu: Sure sure 
Jonathan Neves: The fact that you are nearing a HafÃ¾Ã³r BjÃ¶rnsson level of definition 
Michael Lu: Wtf lmao Well Hereâs some proof that ur also a very dangerous person 
Jonathan Neves: a truly interesting page 
Michael Lu: Yes checkmate 
Jonathan Neves: but now things are starting to make sense 
Michael Lu: Indisputable truth 
Jonathan Neves: you are praying to cthulu to grow the muscles to never before seen levels 
Michael Lu: I donât know about that 
Jonathan Neves: you seem very eldritch 
Michael Lu: No u 
Jonathan Neves: enjoy the abyss he has you in its clear the great dreamer has you dreaming 
Michael Lu: O my O my

Conversation:
Jonathan Wong: hey michael for the lab how do you find the rocket initial velocity do we calculate for all the free fall times or just one of them 
Michael Lu: I didn't start it yet. But ideally they should all be the same right (same vi but angle changes)? Ask others, but I might just do one of them. 
Jonathan Wong: oh but that concerns free fall 
Michael Lu: It's all free fall Wdym 
Jonathan Wong: yeah and it says to use 90 degrees as the angle 
Michael Lu: Ohh I see 
Jonathan Wong: yeah so that's why i was unsure 
Michael Lu: Last lab we used max Idk if that's his convention 
Jonathan Wong: well i did all three so ill just delete 
Michael Lu: Keep them just use the largest value Unless you want to avg it TBH someone else might know better 
Jonathan Wong: i don't care you're the smartest kid and the one that's actually helping rn alright how do i linearize the equation r=v2sintheta/g 
Michael Lu: x = sin(2 * theta)? m = v^2/g I didn't do it yet but that's what I think 
Jonathan Wong: ok but how do i alter my numbers though like i'm not sure what to do with my angles do i plug them in and plot? 
Michael Lu: Plug in all the angles used into sin(2 * theta) But plot the result of that expression 
Jonathan Wong: yeah and then the ranges are just the ranges right? 
Michael Lu: Not the angle Yea 
Jonathan Wong: ok then i set that equal to v2/g to find v? and then i'm good to go right? 
Michael Lu: To determine v, set v^2/g to the slope desmos gives u And solve for v 
Jonathan Wong: alright cool thanks a lot dude 
Michael Lu: Yep np 
Jonathan Wong: when you do it and you figure out something's wrong can you tell me? like if the x isn't sin(2 x theta) 
Michael Lu: Okay 
Jonathan Wong: alright cool yo litty why does 45 degrees produce the largest range 
Michael Lu: Is a question in the lab? 
Jonathan Wong: yeah 
Michael Lu: Umm it optimizes the vertical and horizontal components of velocity to get the max air time and the max horizontal velocity. I think, there might be better explanations online. 
Jonathan Wong: is your explanation sufficient though because that's all i want to put 
Michael Lu: lol that's up to mr wells XD Lemme look it up Yeah I think that should do it, there are some legit yahoo answers explanations too 
Jonathan Wong: alright cool 
Michael Lu: Yah after doing the lab everything seems to work. Btw, idk if you can do this but choose the air time for the free fall that gives you the vi closest to your projectile vi To minimize your percent error ;) 


Conversation:
Jonathan Wong: yo litty percent difference isn't percent error right? https://www.desmos.com/calculator/nhbiatel9f hey litty can you check my graph to see if it's correct 
Michael Lu: can you send a picture 
Jonathan Wong: wait you can't see that? uh I don't really know how to send a picture 
Michael Lu: Screenshot Prt Sc on computer and crtl v into the chat 
Jonathan Wong: oh wow holy shit bruh you saved me so much time 
Michael Lu: Adjust the scale and label the y axis? Oh wait y axis is labeled nvm 
Jonathan Wong: is there anything wrong with the line itself 
Michael Lu: No 
Jonathan Wong: like my line of best fit is atrocious why is my r so bad though? 
Michael Lu: Idk what r is 
Jonathan Wong: the r value like the measure of best fit is so poor for my graph 
Michael Lu: Yeah but idek what it means Oh Idk if Wells cares I think if you did the graph right you should be fine 
Jonathan Wong: alright thanks lol your whole table getting 105's though I'm definitely sitting with you guys from now on my dude 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Jonathan Wong: also you ethan and jen are such a squad have you known each other for a really long time or something? 
Michael Lu: Yah 


Conversation:
Jonathan Wong: hey litty for the convergence tests can we only delete the constant or the coefficient when we use the comparison test ? 
Michael Lu: Constants 
Jonathan Wong: or can we use them like whenever like there's the principal that says deleting the constants or everything else other than the leading term will not affect the divergence or convergence 
Michael Lu: Oh That's not a test That's describing general behavior of series 
Jonathan Wong: oh yeah but can we do it for all series then regardless of the test we're using 
Michael Lu: Yeah if it helps 
Jonathan Wong: like 1/x+6 can we get rid of the six if it helps? 
Michael Lu: Wait I'm sorry, you can delete constants with the comparison tests You can remove terms and factor out coefficients and it won't affect series behavior my bad Changing formulas can only be used with comparison tests 
Jonathan Wong: what doess changing formulas mean? 
Michael Lu: Removing constants and non-leading terms (In polynomials) 
Jonathan Wong: so I can't remove 6 in 1/x+6 unless I'm doing comparison? 
Michael Lu: Is the 6 in the denominator? 
Jonathan Wong: yeah 
Michael Lu: Yeah remove it only for comparisons 
Jonathan Wong: oh ok looks like ill be using comparison a lot what would you do to solve that series 
Michael Lu: ? 
Jonathan Wong: what test would you use to find convergence or divergence of hat series like what do you thnk is the best test for that question 
Michael Lu: Limit comparison 
Jonathan Wong: OH RIGHT ok ill use that every time then or ill see 
Michael Lu: Yah limit comparison is actually easier than regular comparison Just gotta get p right 
Jonathan Wong: litty that bc test though omg 
Michael Lu: Yah it was bad And no bonus 
Jonathan Wong: i gotta stay strong though because physics 
Michael Lu: Yep 
Jonathan Wong: cannot panic dude panicking is so bad 
Michael Lu: Yah especially if it's a math or math-using subject 


Conversation:
Jonathan Wong: hey litty can you help me with the bonus for math? or at least tell me where I can look for help with the problem? 
Michael Lu: hi what about it do you need help :)? 
Jonathan Wong: well I don't know what to do? 
Michael Lu: Well you know how the series error concept thingy 
Jonathan Wong: right 
Michael Lu: |Actual - Approximation| = error Similar concept 
Jonathan Wong: aliright ill try it out and ill see how it goes thanks dude at least the physics test was much better than the calc test honestly so scared about my cal grade though 


Conversation:
Jonathan Wong: hey litty can I have the lab stuff alright coo thanks dude 
Michael Lu: Np 
Jonathan Wong: did you take jen out on that date yet though? bruh dude that was actually hilaorious 
Michael Lu: Yeah It was 
Jonathan Wong: this is the picture I'm talking about today when was this octbober 7 
Michael Lu: Yes 
Jonathan Wong: how was that a long time ago? 
Michael Lu: About a week ago 
Jonathan Wong: sure 


Conversation:
Jonathan Wong: hey litty do I also call 1/0 indeterminate or is there another term for it 
Michael Lu: Undefined 
Jonathan Wong: oh ok I might have to drop math epending on how bad this test was ngl 


Conversation:
Jonathan Wong: hey litty does mass changing impact accerleration? 
Michael Lu: It doesn't rlly 
Jonathan Wong: wait is it because there's no net force 
Michael Lu: Net force increases as mass increases Fnet = m * a, if both m and F increase a should stay the same 
Jonathan Wong: how do you know there's net force is it friction? 
Michael Lu: The net force is the sum of all forces right? 
Jonathan Wong: right 
Michael Lu: So it determines whether and where the object will accelerate The cart accelerated down the incline, so the net force had to be directed down the incline 
Jonathan Wong: oh ok but like what is causing the net force to exist 
Michael Lu: The sum of the normal force, friction, and gravity Adding up all those vectors 
Jonathan Wong: oh ok I gotchu somehow there was an imbalance directed forward 
Michael Lu: Yah 
Jonathan Wong: we just don't know exactly what they are that makes sense sorry I'm using our chat as a place to copyu and paste this thanks for all your help did you finish the lab? 
Michael Lu: kinda did you need to plot a line? i mean does mr wells want us to? 
Jonathan Wong: I think so I believe he says that we always need to connect the dots or something said* 
Michael Lu: ok 
Jonathan Wong: is my fbd right? 
Michael Lu: yassss 
Jonathan Wong: how do I explain question #4 
Michael Lu: what is question 4 
Jonathan Wong: From the diagrams above, it can be seen that gravity is responsible for creating the net force acting on the cart in the direction of motion even though it does not act directly in the direction of motion. Explain how the gravity force does not act directly in the direction of motion yet is responsible for creating a net force in that direction. (Hint, while gravity does not act directly in the direction of motion, it âsort of doesâ) 
Michael Lu: errmm, sum up all the force vectors also gravity has a component that acts parallel to the incline 
Jonathan Wong: ok I was thinking about the component but I wasn't sure about that hey litty not sure why our .757 kg mass has a greater acceleration than our 1.104? 
Michael Lu: God plays dice with the universe Labs can't be perfect And there shouldn't rlly be a correlation anyways, the values differ by an insignificant amount. 
Jonathan Wong: oh ok I'm actually so confused by the relationship though what is it 
Michael Lu: Nonexistent 
Jonathan Wong: hey litty do we have any calc test this week or is it next week? 
Michael Lu: This week the twenty 6th 
Jonathan Wong: damn ok thanks man like this where there is no line? 
Michael Lu: That's what I did Idk if I'm right You do you man I mean not putting the line I got the same points yah 
Jonathan Wong: alright cool I'm just going to get rid of the trump and Hillary insults tab 
Michael Lu: Nvm u probably do need best fit lines 
Jonathan Wong: so if I put them am I wrong? 
Michael Lu: No Idk 
Jonathan Wong: wait did you get a square root graph for #1 for the first graph 
Michael Lu: Idk I just did linear It technically should be sinusoids but idk if wells gaf 
Jonathan Wong: oh really because that's not what I saw on my graph I guess ill change it 
Michael Lu: U do u man 
Jonathan Wong: minor changes man I finished most of it thanks to you 


Conversation:
Jonathan Wong: hey litty can you help me with question number 8 part b 
Michael Lu: Hi What what hw is this 
Jonathan Wong: physics 
Michael Lu: The yard machine? 
Jonathan Wong: yeah 
Michael Lu: The thingy moves at a constant speed Fnet = 0 
Jonathan Wong: uh huh 
Michael Lu: Find the horizontal component of the force Which should be equal to the retarding force (opposing force) bc Fnet = 0 
Jonathan Wong: I mean part b 
Michael Lu: So part c? Is ur guy pushing up or down? 
Jonathan Wong: yeah 
Michael Lu: :/ 
Jonathan Wong: determine the normal force 
Michael Lu: Is he pushing up or down 
Jonathan Wong: exerted vertically upward from the ground 
Michael Lu: Screen shot the problem? Fnet = 0 
Jonathan Wong: in the y direction as well? alright ill try that 
Michael Lu: Fnet = Fn - Fapplied - Fg 
Jonathan Wong: right ok and F applied is Fsintheta? 
Michael Lu: Ye 
Jonathan Wong: hey litty what the answer to the electron question 
Michael Lu: Force upward in earth A force left on the negative plate 
Jonathan Wong: ohh I see so like the electron is hovering next to a plate and its pushing back at the plate while it is pulling up on the earth right? 
Michael Lu: Yeah 


Conversation:
Jonathan Wong: hey litty can you explain the tension tipers question to me? the one where the rocket ship is pulling all those things why is tension 0 throughout 
Michael Lu: Idk I forgot his explanation 


Conversation:
Jonathan Wong: yo litty can I ask you for assistance on how to find the continuity for sec x 
Michael Lu: Itâs not continuous Change it to 1/cos(x) 
Jonathan Wong: ok and then what 
Michael Lu: Itâs undefined at certain values 
Jonathan Wong: but how do I find those values though is it just the values of x that make it undefined? 
Michael Lu: When cos(x) = 0 Yah 
Jonathan Wong: oh so that's how I do it for all of them? 
Michael Lu: Most yeah, just consider the domains of the individual functions 
Jonathan Wong: ah I see alright thanks man 


Conversation:
Jonathan Wong: hey litty can I get a picture of the data ? thanks man our car was 146 grams right? 
Michael Lu: 106 idk 


Conversation:
Jonathan Wong: can you help me with this question 
Michael Lu: Show your work To me 
Jonathan Wong: ok so I did Fnet x=max so this is for part a I did 159cos22-Fk=max Fk= mg-Fsin 22 I mean Fk=mg+Fsin22 then I plugged in an solved I guess times the coefficient of static friction to get fk I'm just wondering if my method of one force - friction= max is right or are two forces pulling and pushing at the same time 
Michael Lu: Same time 
Jonathan Wong: shooting so I have two Fcos thetas thne but what about friction how do I do that with two different forces 
Michael Lu: u * (mg - Fy(pull) + Fy(push)) 
Jonathan Wong: thanks man 


Conversation:
Jonathan Wong: yo litty calculator or no calculator tomorrow? 
Michael Lu: Idk 


Conversation:
Jonathan Wong: hey litty can i have the procedure fo rth elab btw the cart was 104 grams 
Michael Lu: Tf? Yeah but the total is what matters What were your coefficients in the end? 
Jonathan Wong: well yeah but you can't have the right total without the right cart mass my coefficients were bad because i used a 106 cart .418 for 1.146 .417 for 1.646 .476 for 2.146 but those will change a little the first trial of our 1.646 mass was particularly low producing an inaccurate measure but that's what i got hbu? what did you get for reasons of error for exmaple 
Michael Lu: Wait whyâd you use those masses 
Jonathan Wong: becayse i didn't know the cart was 104 until today did you get number approximately like those 
Michael Lu: No 
Jonathan Wong: what did you get for each 
Michael Lu: 0.43, 0.43, and 0.48 
Jonathan Wong: ok so the first two are a little bit off but the last one is basically teh same 
Michael Lu: I used different masses 
Jonathan Wong: would you say that there's significant different 
Michael Lu: 0.04 kg less than yours 
Jonathan Wong: between the numbers no right? 
Michael Lu: Idk 
Jonathan Wong: they're only hundreths off did you finish the lab yet? 
Michael Lu: Yes 
Jonathan Wong: what were your reasons for error 
Michael Lu: Pulling wasnât steadily increased 
Jonathan Wong: oh i said we pulled too hard and produced bad force curves 
Michael Lu: ð 
Jonathan Wong: i honestly couldn't come up with too many reasons i also said we didn't pull on the same spot that's like legit because it was part of the lab but it was something we didn't do could i also say it's difficult to identify precisely the top of the curve or no 
Michael Lu: No 


Conversation:
Jonathan Wong: hey litty did you find the mass of the pig or the Fg of the pig 
Michael Lu: You measured the weighth 
Jonathan Wong: no nvm I don't need it btw the velocities I got were way different 
Michael Lu: Okay 
Jonathan Wong: i don't know why though i used 2pir/t for one right? 
Michael Lu: Maybe you just had bad measurements 
Jonathan Wong: and the other i used v=rad (R tan theta g) right? 
Michael Lu: Yess 
Jonathan Wong: well one is vastly smaller than the other than just by looking at it no? dude i have a percent error of 500% this is not ok 
Michael Lu: Darn 
Jonathan Wong: what did you get 
Michael Lu: 1.34 1.47 
Jonathan Wong: for percent error? 
Michael Lu: 9% 
Jonathan Wong: what do 1.34 and 1.47 represent 
Michael Lu: Itâs percent difference Velocity 
Jonathan Wong: wait how the hell does the ball move at 1.34 m/s 
Michael Lu: Oh wait Idk the math 
Jonathan Wong: oh i see the small ball yeah i got 1.04 
Michael Lu: Iâm talking about the pig 
Jonathan Wong: oh nvm i got you too i forgot everything had to be in meters and kilograms it's better my numbers are 2.704 and 1.69 still bad but not 500% 
Michael Lu: Yes Nvm percent error Is what do 
Jonathan Wong: uh can you repeat the question? 
Michael Lu: Use percent error 
Jonathan Wong: oh ok 


Conversation:
Jonathan Wong: litty what did you get for the question above the last one the line 
Michael Lu: Idk I forgot 


Conversation:
Jonathan Wong: hey litty why is v greatest at the bottom 
Michael Lu: Yes Oh Once the car goes up the loop It loses its speed due to gravityâs tangential acceleration So the max speed has to be before gravity slows it 
Jonathan Wong: ok could I also explain it like as it approaches the bottom the Fgx component keeps increasing, constantly increasing acceleration, until it just becomes Fg all together at which point the velocity is the greatest? 
Michael Lu: Fgx? Like tangent 
Jonathan Wong: yeah before it gets to the bottom it has to be Fgx 
Michael Lu: Wdym 
Jonathan Wong: like I know what you mean but I need a more direct explanation the tangential acceleration has to be Fgx before it gets to the bottom 
Michael Lu: Yeah until the bottom where fgx = 0 
Jonathan Wong: uh huhh oh so when it's at the bottom and there's only Fg there's no more tangential right? 
Michael Lu: Only Fg downward Yeah 
Jonathan Wong: oh ok so we can think of it like a limit it gets infinitely large as it's just barely away from the bottom and therefore the velocity is the greatest? is that wrong 
Michael Lu: Fgx decreases as you approach the bottom 
Jonathan Wong: oh so it would get infinitely smaller alright never mind 
Michael Lu: Yeah but it does hit 0 
Jonathan Wong: ill use your explanation it's easier thanks 


Conversation:
Jonathan Wong: yo litty how did you calculate the weight force for each of them when I divided the forces by 9.8 they were too small to be the weight like david's for example his weight force that you said was 916.7 but if you divide that by 93.54 oh wait never kg nvm* 
Michael Lu: Ok

Jonathan Wong: thanks man oh I know Iol thanks bruh 


Conversation:
Jonathan Wong: hey littty 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Jonathan Wong: do you have the weisswange review questions answers my email is jwong5 alright that works thanks man 
Michael Lu: Some of them might be wrong Ask Jen Luo if u have any questions She also did then 
Jonathan Wong: alright thanks bro 
Michael Lu: Wait One of the answers 2/3 
Jonathan Wong: can you explain what the hint means to me as well ok wait but can you explain the thing to me again the hitn 
Michael Lu: Where What hitn 
Jonathan Wong: the mp thing where we have to be careful about f prime or f double prime and can you give me like an exmaple 
Michael Lu: When ur writing the derivative notation, make sure you have the write the right number of apostrophes? Iâm not sure what u mean 
Jonathan Wong: no it was about how he wants us to be careful about the notation on the McLaurin polynomial but I'm asking you how does that change it like if he gives us f prime of a McLaurin or taylor polynomial is it missing like one term? that we need to know to write in to get the original ? 
Michael Lu: Idk sry man I think u better ask someone else 
Jonathan Wong: alright 


Conversation:
Jonathan Wong: hey litty whats the anti derivative of 1/2t 
Michael Lu: 1/4 * t^4? + C 
Jonathan Wong: isn't the derivative of that t^3 ? oh I mean this 1/(2t) 
Michael Lu: Oh 1/2 * ln(|t|) 
Jonathan Wong: oh right god I feel so dumb thanks man 
Michael Lu: Np Johnathann 
Jonathan Wong: woah what's up with that egregious spelling 
Michael Lu: Jonathan***** Egregious Autocorrect 
Jonathan Wong: who do you have for enlgihs I need to have a talk with them about your Terrible spelling 
Michael Lu: Graham the Great 
Jonathan Wong: oh this is going to be good I have him too what a coincedence 


Conversation:
Jonathan Wong: hey litty why does the max force on an object double if the amp is doubled but not quadruple isn't usp delta x squared?

Jonathan Wong: yo litty for 1/t integration from 1 to 2 i entered it into my calculator for 250 triangles but it didn't work so i plug in sigma x=1 to 250 of (1/1+.004x)(.004) and it gives me 1/(.004x+1) that's literally what i typed in is it because im in scratchpad 
Michael Lu: Iâm in scratchpad 
Jonathan Wong: no you're in scatchpad too wtf 
Michael Lu: What did you get aaa result 
Jonathan Wong: i told you 
Michael Lu: Send a screenshot 
Jonathan Wong: 1/ (.004x+1) is there something i need to change with settings like the entry is exactly yours 
Michael Lu: S end a screenshot Use a multiplication sign Try dat 
Jonathan Wong: wdym i already am 
Michael Lu: Between x and 0.0004 
Jonathan Wong: got it thanks bro good luck tommoro man im going to sleep now 
Michael Lu: U too 


Conversation:
Jonathan Wong: yo litty can i have help with number 16 on webass 
Michael Lu: yes 
Jonathan Wong: alright slowly step by step tell me if my equations are right my first equation is t2=mg my second is t1r=t23.5r and my third is t1= t2+mg are those correct? 
Michael Lu: idk if the first and third are right the method of solving the stuffs is changing the pivot to eliminate certain variables right 
Jonathan Wong: right 
Michael Lu: also by t1 and t2 do you mean torque or tension? 
Jonathan Wong: tension can i just have a picture of your work please and also what's the answer to 17 
Michael Lu: yeah lemme make that hold on MS Paint OG 
Jonathan Wong: can i see your work for 17 as well is it -2mgr+mgr =I a/r I times a/r so then i combine the left side i multiply both sides by 1/r and on the right i get I times a/r^2 right? 
Michael Lu: don't use mg and stuff just use t1 and t2 otherwise i think you got the right idea 
Jonathan Wong: oh i see what your saying just do t1 times r and t2 times r 
Michael Lu: yassss 
Jonathan Wong: and then cancel out the r by multiplying by 1/r right? ok cool 
Michael Lu: ye 
Jonathan Wong: I'm reading your other thing rn 
Michael Lu: cool beans is it legible? twas made in windows paint 
Jonathan Wong: yeah it is what is the .6 r thing and what is the 5r thing 
Michael Lu: 6 radii 5 radii sub those in for radius 
Jonathan Wong: why those values though 
Michael Lu: which number? 1? 
Jonathan Wong: the 5 and 6 radii 
Michael Lu: look at the pink dot, that's the pivot those radii values are how far away the torques are from the pink pivot 
Jonathan Wong: wait how do you know though? 
Michael Lu: so it said the gray circle is r radii and the T1 is applied on the outside of that grey circle and the total yo yo is 6r in radius 
Jonathan Wong: oh ok no i gotchu i have different numbers 
Michael Lu: oh shive really? 
Jonathan Wong: so for mine i would have 3.5r nd 4.5r i get it now thanks man you helped me finish webass 
Michael Lu: 3.5 and 2.5 i think total yo yo is 3.5 r 
Jonathan Wong: right i didn't know the center thing had a torque either 
Michael Lu: it has mass so it do 
Jonathan Wong: uh huh

Jonathan Wong: hey litty for the webassign why does number 22 why is the answer amplitude 
Michael Lu: Good question Speed and frequency of sound are always constant in same medium When you move closer itâs louder I guess So diff amplitude 


Conversation:
Jonathan Wong: how do you do number 29 the first one is how they did it but how would i recognize that? 
Michael Lu: Dam tbh I Wouldnât Oh Well since thereâs a squared x In the form C - X^2 I guess you consider the Pythagorean identities 
Jonathan Wong: i think i understand they were doing the sin^2x+cos^2x=1 but 4 times that i think 
Michael Lu: Yep

Joseph Feld: Howdy fellow MITer! Are you still working on the graduation speech? I gave mine at my graduation and it was a hit. 
Michael Lu: Yeah still working on it Any tips? 
Joseph Feld: I found it to be really effective to not take it seriously. I spent most of my speech laughing at my own bad jokes and people absolutely loved it 
Michael Lu: Ok ok ð 
Joseph Feld: Like, I kind of embarrassed myself up there, but I had fun and people remembered it and liked it I would do it the same way if I could go back, though :) 
Michael Lu: Cool cool Iâll try to make my speech funny 
Joseph Feld: Good luck! ð 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Did u attempt to give any life advice in your speech? 
Joseph Feld: My speech was about the importance of just being conscious of where your life is going and not just defaulting to going with the flow. My first draft had a whole section about what values you should use when deciding how not to live a default life, but it got too preachy so I made my message just to be thoughtful and so I didn't end up preaching about specific values 
Michael Lu: What was the bulk of the speech about Was it mainly a discussion of your life advice Also did u have a time/word/page limit? 
Joseph Feld: It was mostly stories with my message in the explanation. I told one story, explained how the guy in it was being thoughtful, then told another story, and explained how he was also thoughtful, and then discussed thoughtfulness in the abstract It was focused on the advice with some jokes thrown into the language 
Michael Lu: So the message developed through anecdotes? 
Joseph Feld: Yup! I had a 4 minute time limit, but the principal boosted it to six 
Michael Lu: Oh lol I get 3 min ð¤·ââï¸ 
Joseph Feld: Shoot, that's not much at all Is it an actual time limit or can it be fudged a little? When is it due? 
Michael Lu: Yesterday ;) 
Joseph Feld: If you want another pair of eyes to look it over, let me know ð 
Michael Lu: Haha yup 
Joseph Feld: I'd be happy to proofread if you want 3 minutes was the length of just one anecdote for me 
Michael Lu: Aight aight Cool thx for the help 
Joseph Feld: Good luck!

Michael Lu: Mr. Ko will there be a lot of questions on Polynesian society? 
Joseph Ko: There's around one or two. 
Michael Lu: ok thanks 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Mr. Ko, for tomorrow's LEQ, may the Roman Republic be used as a discussed example (without being an "empire")? Also, may both the Roman Empire and Republic be discussed in the same paragraph with little explicit distinction? And is it okay if the last body paragraph is allocated to comparing/contrasting civilizations discussed? 
Joseph Ko: Roman Republic from Punic Wars onwards fine, before Punic Wars wasn't yet an empire. Plan for final paragraph fine so long as you somehow squeeze in a thesis as backup in case whatever you have in introduction doesn't pass muster. 
Michael Lu: Okay Thanks Mr. Ko Wait... Are we aiming to score for all the historical thinking skills? Or just causation? 
Joseph Ko: Just causation. 
Michael Lu: :| Oh Oops. If I compare the two civilizations does that count as synthesis? :D 
Joseph Ko: Must not be from same time period as question. 
Michael Lu: Oh. Okay. Thank you Mr. Ko 
Joseph Ko: Synthesis requires connection across different time periods.

Conversation:
Katelyn Lee: Hey r u coming to town 
Michael Lu: No 
Katelyn Lee: Tough street of queens 
Michael Lu: â 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Yo katelyn So you know at the paint bar K A T E L Y N Itâs abt ethan & jen 
Katelyn Lee: Yes yes Sorry litty Whatâs up tho 
Michael Lu: Lol nvm 
Katelyn Lee: Did he burst about jenn 
Michael Lu: Yes 
Katelyn Lee: He snapped didnât he 
Michael Lu: Not to her 
Katelyn Lee: To u 
Michael Lu: I think Did he? 
Katelyn Lee: Not yet Heâs about to On Tuesday 
Michael Lu: How do u know 
Katelyn Lee: 8am grace park He told me 
Michael Lu: Ughhh 
Katelyn Lee: And he told me he kind of lost it in front of u 
Michael Lu: What do you think 
Katelyn Lee: So I assumed thatâs why u messaged me I think Ethan is pretty done and tired And I think heâs just angry at this point 
Michael Lu: I know But what do YOU THINK 
Katelyn Lee: From his perspective Jen is the problem, not him Hmmmmm I think his feelings are valid But idk how I feel About him snapping in front of jenn And losing his cool like that 
Michael Lu: Wait idk what has jen done to him Like specifically 
Katelyn Lee: So whenever Ethan talks about Jen He kind of mentions how whenever they hang out Jenn has some kind of grudge against him And kind of just acts like an ass From Jenns perspective Sheâs just treating him normally Ethan thinks she goes out of the way to treat him like garbage He gave an example of how u amanda Ethan and jenn all hung out once And u guys were just sitting there and she wld just throw insults and people didnât know how to react so u guys just awkwardly laughed 
Michael Lu: O I see 
Katelyn Lee: In the beginning I thought he wanted to get back together with jenn Which is why I thought he was offended so easily But according to him he just misses her as a friend and wants to be civil But since sheâs making that difficult he wants to drop her And probably quit scioly Which I did not support but ð¤·ð»ââï¸ 
Michael Lu: Dammm Thx for info 
Katelyn Lee: Yeh the whole jenn thing is making him on edge 
Michael Lu: Because neither Ethan or Jen Have anything Gave* So Tuesday he blows up? 
Katelyn Lee: Thatâs his plan He texted her last night â8am Tuesday grace park we need to talkâ 
Michael Lu: Well I hope heâs civil about it 
Katelyn Lee: Yeah I doubt that 
Michael Lu: â 
Katelyn Lee: ð¤·ð»ââï¸ Heâs just been bottling shit up And doesnât know how to release it So he feels like if he bursts out itâll be better 
Michael Lu: Does Jen actually have a grudge Or is it like subconscious Is is she just normally like this 
Katelyn Lee: Lol I feel like she actually does 
Michael Lu: What was she like at the paint bar 
Katelyn Lee: sheâs trying to mask it by trying to make it seem like the relationship is isnât a big deal But consider that she talks about it all the time I think it is a big deal for her too 
Michael Lu: Lol yeah 
Katelyn Lee: At the paint bar she made it seem like she feels bad for Ethan And I was kinda Saying how he doesnât need u to feel bad Maybe just try to be more civil But in her defense, she is being civil and she thinks Ethan is just being over dramatic or too sensitive 
Michael Lu: Ethan is sensitive Idk how Jen hasnât learned that tho 
Katelyn Lee: Ethan is sensitive but he doesnât like showing it Cause he thinks emotion is weakness Which I think is also stupid af 
Michael Lu: Lol heâs getting angry rn 
Katelyn Lee: What do u mean 
Michael Lu: And heâs proud of it 
Katelyn Lee: Oh yeah thatâs a good description 
Michael Lu: I told him to be rational abt this 
Katelyn Lee: This is Ethan not knowing where to put his emotions 
Michael Lu: B4 he oversteps himself 
Katelyn Lee: Cause heâs never dealt with them before And now that he has to he doesnât know how to just cut her out with out making some sort of scene 
Michael Lu: I agree 
Katelyn Lee: See this is why I consider Ethan to be emotional even tho he disagrees 
Michael Lu: I feel both of em donât know how to handle this 
Katelyn Lee: Yeah theyâre both pretty clueless 
Michael Lu: Even after the first breakup Hereâs a sad pic from Scioly: 
Katelyn Lee: Yeah Ethan thinks he handled it well but I think they just pushed all their feels down Lol this is Ethanâs version of being heartbroken 
Michael Lu: Do you think itâs because he suppressed everything And just avoided her 
Katelyn Lee: YEAH DEFINITELY ETHAN IS TERRIBLE WITH EMOTIONS 
Michael Lu: When I broke up with other jen I ofc had ethan in mind So I like talked to her (albeit I rushed a bit) It got better quicker Idk how Ethan didnât do the same 
Katelyn Lee: He tried 
Michael Lu: When 
Katelyn Lee: He pretty much wants what u and jenn have Heâs tried starting convo with her Tried to be civil But thatâs in his eyes Jenn either doesnât see it Or ethan is just all talk 
Michael Lu: He probably didnât try hard or long enough 
Katelyn Lee: I feel like Heâs been trying enough Just because he got to a point Where he wants to burst 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Katelyn Lee: Ethan and I got close because he talked about jenn And itâs been awhile Maybe like During ap week 
Michael Lu: I see 
Katelyn Lee: And then during the summer he wanted to be friends with her again Which I took as a âI want to be in a relationship with herâ but he said it was just cause he missed her as a friend since theyâve been friends for so long But I didnât get why heâd put so much effort into it And so I asked him And he said for any other person heâd probably just drop them But not jenn Jenn is special 
Michael Lu: Dam I see 
Katelyn Lee: In my opinion this is Ethan being heartbroken even if he doesnât look at it that way lol 
Michael Lu: So u think heâs attached In like a Special way 
Katelyn Lee: Jenn thinks she didnât feel much for the relationship at all so she doesnât understand why Ethan is acting out Yeah Heâs attached Since theyâve been friends for awhile before the relationship And I mean I get it 
Michael Lu: Shit why did Jen even date him a 2nd time then 
Katelyn Lee: Iâve known nick for like 6 years or so and I get it. Like itâll suck if we break up cause we were best friends before and it feels like youâre just flushing 6 years of time away Jen says itâs cause she felt bad But I think thatâs bs Ethan and jenn are both hard people to read cause they never express emotions seriously 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Katelyn Lee: So them as a couple, makes things difficult cause they canât even read each other Which is why both of them always talk about each other 
Michael Lu: Dam I see 
Katelyn Lee: Does he talk to u about jenn 
Michael Lu: No... Idk why 
Katelyn Lee: Iâll be honest 
Michael Lu: Probably doesnât see me as a relationship coach 
Katelyn Lee: I think he just talks to me the most Cause of my relationship with nick 
Michael Lu: Yeah I thought He looks up to nick an Sm 
Katelyn Lee: Yeah but I also talk shit about my relationship too So itâs like A mixture of relationship talks whenever I talk to Ethan 
Michael Lu: Dam 
Katelyn Lee: Yeah I wish Ethan didnât put nick on a high pedestal tho Hey so Ethan is probably gonna snap at jen 
Michael Lu: Shit Yeah ik I saw him in town today 
Katelyn Lee: Um heâs Kinda crazy 
Michael Lu: Lol yeah I know 
Katelyn Lee: Yeah he told me when he saw u jenn and Annie That he got so mad 
Michael Lu: Iâll try to get to him I said hi He Didnât seem to pleased Did Jen accept the confrontation? 
Katelyn Lee: I actually have no idea Ethan just texted me randomly today and said he was pissed And I asked why And he said it was cause he saw u jenn and Annie in town And I was like okayy???? And?? But that was it 
Michael Lu: Shit should I walk home with him? 
Katelyn Lee: Wait heâs not home? 
Michael Lu: Is he not in town Idk heâs in sb Iâm in vivis with Jen Annie and Amanda 
Katelyn Lee: I feel like he went home 
Michael Lu: Iâll go check sb later I guess? 
Katelyn Lee: Like wtf???? 
Michael Lu: Yeah I get it Itâs complicated 
Katelyn Lee: No like weâve talked about stuff like this before But heâs never been this angry 
Michael Lu: Heâs probably at the convergence of a bunch of tough shit 
Katelyn Lee: Jesus 
Michael Lu: Is this Like rn 
Katelyn Lee: Yupppp 
Michael Lu: Ughhh Yo u free tmrw 
Katelyn Lee: Not tmrw but probablt Tuesday Why? 
Michael Lu: Shit Iâm dining with Ethan tmrw night And u know 
Katelyn Lee: Seems to have cooled down a lot 
Michael Lu: Good Fucking good 
Katelyn Lee: He needs to find better coping mechanisms Ok Ik he wants to be a robot But he isnât 
Michael Lu: Lol yeah 
Katelyn Lee: So he has to learn how to deal with his emotions instead of trying to shove them under

Katherine Hui: aka led ohhh ok thatâs right k thanks 
Michael Lu: What does the actual ir receiver look like What activates the transmitter? 
Katherine Hui: i think itâs just the remote control button 
Michael Lu: I mean like in the mission directions 
Katherine Hui: i think this is what weâre looking for we donât have the IR LED though so we might have to order it 
Michael Lu: Idk does that mean youâll have to buy a new receiver? Looks less shady ^ amazon 
Katherine Hui: we can use two boards with that right 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Katherine Hui: hm ok ill tell spinelli to order it 
Michael Lu: If ur using that 
Katherine Hui: ok so we canât do the receiver or transmitter now i guess uhh can u help with the temp sensor itâs not uploading to the board 
Michael Lu: Umm I can still write the IR code Whatâs up with the temp 
Katherine Hui: wait can u see the pic LOL not the ghost lmfao 
Michael Lu: Err can get a straight pic Lol wth is a semaphore 
Katherine Hui: no idea LMAO 
Michael Lu: Whatâs the UNO com number 
Katherine Hui: changed the port same thing 
Michael Lu: Whatâs the com on device manager Try switching off laptop Bluetooth??? Also what does ur motor relay look like 
Katherine Hui: whereâs the uno com number 
Michael Lu: Wait try switching off Bluetooth And changing the COM back to the original number 4 I should be able to help yâall out at Jenvitational Did the temperature sensor work 
Katherine Hui: itâs still not uploading to the board 
Michael Lu: Did u turn off Bluetooth 
Katherine Hui: ya 
Michael Lu: Oh sheen What does the error look like Switch back to COM 4 Plug and unplug the arduino? Lol 
Katherine Hui: yeah we keep doing that lol 
Michael Lu: Fuq 
Katherine Hui: do we have to set up the circuit before plugging it in 
Michael Lu: Wdym 
Katherine Hui: like put the temp sensor and the cables in the arduino and the breadboard then plug the arduino in 
Michael Lu: Nah I donât think so?? Ty a new sketch Try a blank sketch And upload that See if it works 
Katherine Hui: blank sketch doesnât work either wth 
Michael Lu: Is the board unplugged from all the electronic components? 
Katherine Hui: yes 
Michael Lu: Do you have a spare Arduino? And is your COM port correct? 
Katherine Hui: yeah we tried it with two different boards we disconnected all the other bluetooth devices and thereâs only COM3 now 
Michael Lu: Screenshot the error I canât read some parts I have to go to robotics Maybe the Arduino forums might have info Idk maybe your board COM is wrong or the board type you selected doesnât match up? 
Katherine Hui: hm it detected the board as COM3 but it keeps saying error uploading to COM3 GOT IT i changed the settings to com1 and now it uploaded LITTY OMG we found an IR receiver and transmitter 
Michael Lu: Aight Iâll send u the code when I get home 


Conversation:
Katherine Hui: which libraries do we need to download wait jk we got it btw for the transmitter did u define which pins to connect them to ? 


Conversation:
Katherine Hui: THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE HELP LITTY ill make sure ur mom and dad wonât beat u 
Michael Lu: np kat ShDoor can u open AA Battery Holder â Classy Edition ;) 
Katherine Hui: o shfancy btw arduinos came in today but we wonât work on it tmr not sure if weâre working on it anymore during break bc weâre all busy but i think weâre at a good spot rn tho thanks again so for ur help litty youâre da shbomb 
Michael Lu: Lol np fam ððð 


Conversation:
Katherine Hui: why omg 
Michael Lu: ð 


Conversation:
Katherine Hui: did william cai figure out the RPM we needed for the 7 pulley system 
Michael Lu: yeah but tbh im sry to say this but... I really doubt theoretical physics calculations a lot but his values were 31 RPM and 0.0147 Nm oh yeah this was without pulleys by the way, just lifting up a 0.5 kg mass 
Katherine Hui: lolol theoretical b fake aight dw i just want an idea of what kind of motor to buy bc i might just order a 12V one with high torque 
Michael Lu: if ur gonna biuy for better performance you might have to beat this :\ (try to get a motor without encoder) (motor selection sucks btw) 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Err If ur good with the motors we tried to use today Look into highest possible voltage battteries And also high current draw possible (Ah) 
Katherine Hui: these are 12V motors already oooof how much current have you been using to power the motors we have now? 12? 
Michael Lu: Probably like Less than 100 MaH Maybe we can try hovercraft batteries today Weâd probably need batteries with over 1000 mA and over 1000 mAh 


Conversation:
Katherine Hui: where did pins 3 and 4 go into? 
Michael Lu: Wot Ohhh Shibbbbb 
Katherine Hui: two loose green wires 
Michael Lu: Try that Donât worry about the pins on the arduino, just put them where they belong on the breadboard 


Conversation:
Katherine Hui: there arent any motors on amazon that have a higher rpm and a higher torque than the one u have will it be enough to do lift the mass with the harder pulley tho btw litty do u have extra breadboards weâre a few short :( itâs important pls sorry lol 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Katherine Hui: do u mind letting us borrow them lol we need like 3 more 
Michael Lu: Yeah I think theyâre at school 
Katherine Hui: ah ok ill just set up the arduinos then and plug it all in tmr lolol they work btw for a servo motor weâre just gonna hook it up to the salt and water circuit does it work the same way? or do we have to use the arduinos with the servo motors we have now from the kit 
Michael Lu: Wdym How will you power the servo? 
Katherine Hui: the salt and water 
Michael Lu: A salt water battery? You could use the salt water to complete a circuit 


Conversation:
Katherine Hui: litty do u mind helping w the IR bc i took out the other battery source and now itâs all messed up LOL 
Michael Lu: Hohoho 
Katherine Hui: did u change the IR receiver code ? also do u mind sending the code for the motors and photocell if u have them 
Michael Lu: sent idk photocell 
Katherine Hui: shlit yeah ally has photocell i got it omg ur such a troll litty LMFAO deadass why u like this 
Michael Lu: yes 


Conversation:
Katherine Hui: were u able to get the ambient light sensor to work? 
Michael Lu: Yeah I sent code 
Katherine Hui: wait did u shine an LED on it and the motor started? itâs not going right now lol 
Michael Lu: Yeah shine something 
Katherine Hui: the motor isnât starting the serial monitor is printing the Ding 
Michael Lu: Umm 
Katherine Hui: but the motor isnât turning on ? 
Michael Lu: Did u plug in a battery 
Katherine Hui: for the motor ? 
Michael Lu: Yes 
Katherine Hui: yes 9V no worky :(

Conversation:
Michael Lu: How good can u arduino? 
Katherine Hui: i canât code so not good at all 
Michael Lu: ð¤ What if I sent you the code Could you rig up the wiring setup 
Katherine Hui: yeah i could do that much 
Michael Lu: Keep in touch ð¤ Aight hereâs the deal Kat,

A few months ago the rEaDEr told me to make a robotic pacing robot. I did some research, turns out thereâs only one of these by Puma called the BeatBot, but it got discontinued or something so it ded...

I want to make something similar, but Iâm backed up on two other robotics projects rn and Iâm not in GN, so much appreciate if u help.

If you can do some basic wiring for the robot thatâd help a lot and save me time.

Much thx. Lmk if u down or nah. 
Katherine Hui: all the wiring stuff is in the scioly room so i dont think i have any arduino boards at my house :( 
Michael Lu: Lol ik but I have most of the stuff 
Katherine Hui: ohh okay sure i could try my best are u coming to practice monday if u want that day u can give me whatever u need me to do 
Michael Lu: Yup Cool thx ð 


Conversation:
Katherine Hui: o i left school already so just bring me the arduino stuff on thursday lmaooo 


Conversation:
Katherine Hui: shiiiit no arduinos this year uhhhhhh theyâre all like physical simple machines or chemical tasks

Conversation:
Michael Lu: Umm Generally speaking U attend English class More than I do 
Katherine Hui: LMAO 
Michael Lu: Soooo 
Katherine Hui: do i tho i missed a lot of classes 
Michael Lu: Ummm doubt Well U at least take notes So youâll be of much use 
Katherine Hui: lol what are u asking for 
Michael Lu: Any ideas for these q Well If he makes us write an essay abt women tmrw Might as well drop 
Katherine Hui: LOL omg facts 
Michael Lu: So disregard 9 if u wish I suppose 
Katherine Hui: ill start a "review" sheet now i guess 
Michael Lu: Woah woah woah lol no u donât have to 
Katherine Hui: and add whatever thoughts i have to it 
Michael Lu: Just asking if u have any notes for 3, 4, and 8 Or any memories of a discussion? 
Katherine Hui: for 3 u could definitely talk about the hunt and temptation scenes and 4 also i also suppose 9 if u wanna go misogynistic lol 
Michael Lu: Lol Iâm just gonna pass on 9 
Katherine Hui: for 8 we questioned whether Gawain or the code inherently at fault and the jocular tone can support the idea that it is the code that is imperfect bc the entire game was seen as a joke the whole time to everyone except Gawain or something like that that was today so the passage to support it was in  Fytte 4 S16 also 17 and 22 when the knight and the court laugh i think for most of the poem the narrator describes it as a "game" with the same playful tone ie. Fytte 1 S13-14 but i think u can identify some incongruities with the pentangle scene? 
Michael Lu: Wdym Pentax Incongruous 
Katherine Hui: like the idea that Gawain "represents" the knights with the pentangle and this symbol defines the code of chivalry as this perfect ideal that all knights should follow but we see by the end the ambiguity of the code 
Michael Lu: ðð Sounds good chief 
Katherine Hui: no prob chef 
Michael Lu: thx u I O U 
Katherine Hui: yeet lmk if u need other passages

Katherine Hui: i meant in manuel's class LOL 
Michael Lu: We never did it in manuals from what little I can remember 
Katherine Hui: LOL i never did it in amelio's class soooo 
Michael Lu: Oh Well donât think we did it this year? Maybe do another just to be safe unless u rlly want this one 
Katherine Hui: yeah ill do a diff one oh the "Thenglish" one is referring to the poets and making sure they write in mostly English, not Latin verse not important 
Michael Lu: Was there a min amount of rules he wanted? 
Katherine Hui: nope but youre not supposed to use all of them, just choose precisely LMFAO omg shit i forgot to include the annotations in the same document F press F for failing english whatever i just need a B for this assignment and itll be fine 
Michael Lu: Yo submit in the makeup Section

Keerthi Kumanan: a)In part B of this procedure, the rocket was fired at an angle and the time was recorded. Was the time more, less or the same as that found in the vertical launch, or to put it another way, to maximize time of flight should the rocket be fired straight up or at an angle?

Michael Lu: Oh so how was handwriting 
Kenneth Tan: itâs fine on Surface 
Michael Lu: O 
Kenneth Tan: I have it on my iPad right now but I use notability Iâm pretty sure itâs fine on iPad Nick used OneNote for iPad I just tried it itâs fine Notability has compatible with the 120hz iPad Pro so itâs smoother for writing is* 
Michael Lu: ð© 
Kenneth Tan: use OneNote if you type a lot and make a lot of diagrams and mind maps or something Notability isnât great for typing and all that stuff but itâs good for written notes 
Michael Lu: ð©

Kevin Ho: so bring a metro card 
Michael Lu: I don't have one 
Kevin Ho: bring money or quarters 
Michael Lu: how much $$? 
Kevin Ho: like $8 for the subway 
Michael Lu: okay 
Kevin Ho: i will have to check with aram for the details but the money you bring is pretty much made up by the fact that we get free food 
Michael Lu: so we are taking the train and subway to get there and back? 
Kevin Ho: yeah or you can get a ride back 
Michael Lu: I might just get my dad to pick me up 
Kevin Ho: yeah thats fine its not an official school trip 
Michael Lu: okay

Conversation:
Michael Lu: happy new yr mm8 hey m8 i have a question what year did you actually get recognized and involved in robotics? 
Kevin Hui: ye? uh 9th grd i was noted somewhat 10th is where i got recognized as the scout head tho not alot of people know me 
Michael Lu: oke bcause before build season, it kinda seems like a pay to get acknowledged thing there's no merit until build season starts 
Kevin Hui: lol yeah no preseason is literally just motch talking and talking and talking... lol 
Michael Lu: ikr 
Kevin Hui: don't worry if you can do something in build season something amazing you'll be recognized 
Michael Lu: are you in the class? 
Kevin Hui: nah i'm just known for my scouting lol 
Michael Lu: ok 
Kevin Hui: i've never touched the robot you know ben newman? 
Michael Lu: i know him 
Kevin Hui: he's going to be our lead programmer this yr for the robot 
Michael Lu: but i doubt he knows me 
Kevin Hui: ask him if you can help out 
Michael Lu: lel 
Kevin Hui: unless you wanna build ofc or maybe you can help me for my scouting app lol 
Michael Lu: they use C or something though 
Kevin Hui: okay so the robot uses LABView 
Michael Lu: i don't know any C based languages 
Kevin Hui: very quick to learn 
Michael Lu: oh the dragndrop 
Kevin Hui: for the app we're using swift i'm learning that right now 
Michael Lu: ok 
Kevin Hui: if you wanna help out w/ any it'd be great 
Michael Lu: okee gtg bye thx for the info 
Kevin Hui: np 


Conversation:
Kevin Hui: Stronghold looks really cool! 
Michael Lu: i know hype but how the hell are you gonna haul a freaking robot up a tower 
Kevin Hui: We did the year before I was a freshman  It's nothing new 
Michael Lu: oh dam, some strong motors then m8, do you know php? 
Kevin Hui: Nah 
Michael Lu: ok do you know what it is uesd for? 
Kevin Hui: Ye  Don't use it tho 
Michael Lu: ? 
Kevin Hui: I know what it's used for, I don't use it

Kevin Hui: No clue lol 
Michael Lu: so i wanna learn it lel thx for the info m8 gonna have a marathon now 
Kevin Hui: Lol

Kevin Hui: If you have a game in mind before you go into the competition you should be fine on time 
Michael Lu: don't they choose the theme the day of tho? 
Kevin Hui: Ask Justin and Elissa about their game at Islip, they got first I think Just think of a generic game to base on and mold the theme to that That's what the winners do 
Michael Lu: k thx :) 
Kevin Hui: Np 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Hey Kevin 
Kevin Hui: Oh hey what up 
Michael Lu: I heard you were really good at securing solid internships as a freshman. 
Kevin Hui: Haha where'd you hear that 
Michael Lu: Also checked ur LinkedIn ð 
Kevin Hui: So you're interested in trotting the terrible path that is a cs career huh 
Michael Lu: Low key I guess 
Kevin Hui: Its good to start! 
Michael Lu: What do u do for prepping resume, landing internship positions, doing (technical) interviews 
Kevin Hui: Lots and lots of stuff lol 
Michael Lu: As a freshie 
Kevin Hui: You're at MIT rn right 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Kevin Hui: That already gives you a leg up on a couple of other kids starting out haha Theres a fair amount of work thats involved in landing the freshie internship I'd start out by just asking what you're aiming for What's ideal, what would you settle for, and who can you ask to get started The classic advice is that since you have no experience, side projects and hackathons are good things to go to Pretty sure hackMIT has their hackathon in like a week? Maybe the deadline passed already :/ 
Michael Lu: Definitely want a good internship for summer 
Kevin Hui: Define good Are you looking at Big 4? 
Michael Lu: I mean i have high school exp 
Kevin Hui: FAANG? Or would you be happier with a company with a lesser brand Or happy** Everyone wants google ofc lol 
Michael Lu: Lol wait can I call u later Do u mind 
Kevin Hui: Uhhh rn? 
Michael Lu: Not Rn Later tonight ? 
Kevin Hui: Lmao how late 
Michael Lu: What time do u prefer If not today itâs fine lol 
Kevin Hui: In like 20 minutes would be good 
Michael Lu: Aight 12;30 Cool thx man Mind if I call? 
Kevin Hui: BTW if you're interested in the hackathon route, theres actually a set of hackathons that are generally considered "must apply" hackathons and are fairly prestigious amongst that community I think pennapps is the most famous HackMIT, hackharvard, hackprinceton are all fairly well known ones to They give out alot of food and swag, and you can meet pretty cool people there! 
Michael Lu: Aight thx for info! 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Do u prefer HackerRank or leetcode Also how does the âhacker rankâ interview work 
Kevin Hui: Leetcode >>>>> hackerrank The hackerrank interview is basically just a leetcode question 
Michael Lu: Is it remote and is it timed? 
Kevin Hui: Uhh So yes its timed and you do it on your own Theres no other engineer interviewing you then if thats what youre thinking That usually comes after the coding sample ( aka the hackerrank ) Cheating is generally discouraged (obviously) because even if you get past the sample, you'll end up bombing the phone interview Got a hackerrank interview? 
Michael Lu: No lol Just heard abt it 
Kevin Hui: Gotcha They're... not fun :( But then again all of cs interviewing is terrible 
Michael Lu: O lol How much time per question 
Kevin Hui: For a coding sample? 
Michael Lu: Technical Interview questions yah 
Kevin Hui: Its whatever the number of questions is on the coding sample and your allotted time E.g. it could be like 3 questions in 2 hours Or if they're lenient it could be 3 in 24 hours Very random lol 
Michael Lu: What abt in person technical interview questions 
Kevin Hui: Coding interviews over the phone are usually 45 - 60 minutes long Similar for in person 
Michael Lu: Per question or total 
Kevin Hui: Usually 20 minutes per question So yes You have to solve a leetcode medium in 20 minutes lol 
Michael Lu: Ah gotcha 
Kevin Hui: I think thats a terrible way of judging someone's ability to code but c'est la vie 
Michael Lu: Yep lol 
Kevin Hui: How's mit treating ya 
Michael Lu: Aight aight 
Kevin Hui: Find your group of friends yet? Any clubs? 
Michael Lu: Yeah found friends Rlly cool ppl here Joined entrepreneurship club 
Kevin Hui: Good stuff Enjoy freshman year! It's an interesting one 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: How long does it take to get competent for technical interviews? Rn it takes me 30+ min for a lot of leetcode questions Of the several Iâve done 
Kevin Hui: It takes a while haha Even now im not amazing 
Michael Lu: What do they make u do in technical interviews Besides writing code On a board 
Kevin Hui: Theres a great video on this Looking like googles guide to technical interviews or smth 
Michael Lu: Do they care if your code works With like nuances and debugging for instance edge cases Or is it more of a holistic Judgment 
Kevin Hui: Yes and yes 
Michael Lu: About the interviewees thought process 
Kevin Hui: Your code should work But your process also matters 
Michael Lu: How do they know if it works if itâs on a white board Lol 
Kevin Hui: They can usually spot if it works Trust me lol after doing this for a while you see if someones made a mistake 
Michael Lu: Oh true lol 
Kevin Hui: But yeah just keep going at it 
Michael Lu: R u free for a call rn 
Kevin Hui: Uhhh not rn haha 
Michael Lu: Lol ok 
Kevin Hui: Maybe in an hour 
Michael Lu: Iâll just text and u can respond whenever 
Kevin Hui: Sure! 
Michael Lu: I feel like at MIT, especially for freshmen thereâs a big mismatch of skill sets and experience, at least in my case 
Kevin Hui: Wdym haha 
Michael Lu: Really good coding kids did a lot of olympiads at the expense of high school internships/jobs, so they donât have âwork experienceâ per se despite their qualifications 
Kevin Hui: Right 
Michael Lu: Since recruiters donât know about half that stuff they donât rlly offer interviews In my case, I have a good amount of work experience 
Kevin Hui: Yeah thatll happen 
Michael Lu: But that cane at the expense of studying comp sci fundamentals algorithms and stuff So even if I do get an interview based on my resume, I wonât pass the technical portion 
Kevin Hui: I wouldn't put too much stress about that Just prep as much as you can haha 
Michael Lu: Lol yeah Iâm just wondering if the same happened at northeastern Or whether you think my theory makes sense 
Kevin Hui: We certainly dont have super olympiad style coders by the dozens Maybe a few 
Michael Lu: Generally speaking then, what helps you guys break that work experience barrier to getting your first internship Personal projects? Coursework? Awards? Research at the university? 
Kevin Hui: Personal projects + research + whatever work exp you have Its about the best you can do till you get your first internship 
Michael Lu: Yep Aight thx for the info Kevin! 
Kevin Hui: Overall i wouldnt worry too much about tech interview compared to the USACO kids, enough prep you get will eventually catch up to pass most interviews haha Just uh Dont freak out about prepping hard to the point where you feel like you'll answer all interview questions correctly 100% of the time Cause that wont happen all the time 
Michael Lu: Yep ð 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Lol just completed my first HackerRank challenge 
Kevin Hui: Haha Which company? 
Michael Lu: Solved both problems with 10 min to spare, but had a lot of errors when doing âRun Codeâ Do they analyze my code and 
Kevin Hui: eh sometimes they look at your code sometimes they don't 
Michael Lu: See the metrics on submissions? Company was Toast 
Kevin Hui: ohhh toast haha i know a few friends working there i wouldn't worry about it if you passed both problems 
Michael Lu: So itâs just for completion? Lol I hope 
Kevin Hui: they just wanna get a feel for your code style and to see if you could write basic leetcode stuff pretty simple most of the times though some coding samples are absolute bitches 
Michael Lu: My bugs were pretty stupid, so like idk the process was a bumpy ride 
Kevin Hui: haha its gonna be like that for a while 
Michael Lu: Yup so I guess the process matters more during the in person or phone interview But less during the hacker tank? 
Kevin Hui: yup the hackerrank is more just like 
Michael Lu: Because the hacker tank is just screening to weed out if you canât code at all? 
Kevin Hui: a filter initially yup 
Michael Lu: Got it 
Kevin Hui: the phone/on site interviews are generally harder 
Michael Lu: Thx Kevin! 
Kevin Hui: np 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Do u or ur friends know what the Toast phone interview questions were like? 
Kevin Hui: Uh i could ask 
Michael Lu: Lol thx !!! 
Kevin Hui: sent out a message to her i'll lyk if she responds She got back to me She said the phone interview is just with hr so nbd its just behavioral lol 
Michael Lu: Oh shit Thereâs no technical phone interview? 
Kevin Hui: Nope its the onsite i guess Good luck! 
Michael Lu: Thx! 


Conversation:
Kevin Hui: how's the process going? get any other interviews?

Kevin Hui: haha i've heard horror stories about your psets 
Michael Lu: Yeah theyâre definitely true 
Kevin Hui: loving it so far tho? 
Michael Lu: Yes and no Iâve definitely become better at coding from my coding class 
Kevin Hui: soliddd we should meet up for lunch or smth sometime! i used to walk across your campus to get to work lol

Michael Lu: graham 
Kimberly Lu: OMG YES I HAD GRAHAM 
Michael Lu: lol we share 2 classes 
Kimberly Lu: WTF PHYSICS AND MATH 
Michael Lu: chamber 
Kimberly Lu: I might switch math though 
Michael Lu: oh snap physics too lit 
Kimberly Lu: with sci research yass I heard Wells is the best 
Michael Lu: wait, so how was graham? 
Kimberly Lu: uhhh well In terms of grades or how he teaches 
Michael Lu: both 
Kimberly Lu: Wait Emma had graham Ask her 
Michael Lu: but that was a while ago 
Kimberly Lu: So apparently graham never gives higher than a 95 for the final grade 
Michael Lu: wtf u srs 
Kimberly Lu: so if you want to save your GPA maybe go with Hastings yeah also I had him pd 1 and I was late everyday and he made fun of me all the time for that and I kept falling asleep in his class 
Michael Lu: how is the teaching 
Kimberly Lu: I think I'm biased bc he kept making fun of me all the time but like to me the class was boring and he spent the period teaching the insignificant things 
Michael Lu: oh god :( 
Kimberly Lu: and put up 1000883929192 links on google classroom for you to check out and learn by yourself idk I still managed to get a 5 on the AP But I didn't really like his class 
Michael Lu: lol did you have tria? 
Kimberly Lu: nope I had madden the tria kids suffered a lot 
Michael Lu: :( david yao said it was easy A unless he is trolling 
Kimberly Lu: idk from what I heard people got 70s 80s on tests but I think a lot of people got As for final course grade 
Michael Lu: gdarn what gives tho my GPA is gonna plummet 
Kimberly Lu: lol future valedictorian? 
Michael Lu: nope too many hard courses and teachers this year 
Kimberly Lu: It's not that bad dw I thought my GPA was going to fall a lot this year but it turned out okay 
Michael Lu: how okay is okay is that okay? 
Kimberly Lu: uh IDK MAYBE MY OKAY ISN'T AS OKAY AS YOUR OKAY Idk your standards 
Michael Lu: idk we'll see tria + gram = X( 
Kimberly Lu: dw you'll do fine You can always switch out of tria too 
Michael Lu: to what? 
Kimberly Lu: Madden !! 
Michael Lu: he only teaches period 1 or something 
Kimberly Lu: he gives good grades little hw wait never mind 
Michael Lu: does graham give HW? 
Kimberly Lu: He gives a lot of hw but he never checks it 
Michael Lu: oh lol ok :D 
Kimberly Lu: graham... omg graham guides 
Michael Lu: wut 
Kimberly Lu: I was talking about madden before graham gives assignments when you need them least Basically when you're drowning from all the work from other classes 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Kimberly would you be willing to switch physics classes with Bo Yang Zhang  to get pd 4/5 so he can make his senior name BoYang 747? 3/4 physics* 


Conversation:
Kimberly Lu: lol sorry litty I told john this but I can't switch into 3/4 physics bc 4th period is the only period I can take AP Spanish 


Conversation:
Kimberly Lu: Michael is the quiz tmr only on horizontal projectiles? Or angled too 
Michael Lu: Pretty sure it's angled as well 
Kimberly Lu: Thanks Michael! 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Do u have the proof for the alternating series test? Thx 
Kimberly Lu: Uhh not really i just have the diagram that we drew I didn't write down any explanations 
Michael Lu: Lol wait saem Did he explain it? 
Kimberly Lu: I don't think he wrote anything down for explanation but kinda just said it verbally 
Michael Lu: Gdarn oke 
Kimberly Lu: The only thing i wrote was "bounces back and forth until converges to a value" 
Michael Lu: Oh I see 
Kimberly Lu: LOL not much help sorry 
Michael Lu: lol ð Alright thx kimbo 
Kimberly Lu: lol no problem litty Is the stuff on the last quiz on the test too? 
Michael Lu: Besides convergence tests, he usually doesn't spiral in pretty sure 
Kimberly Lu: Wait so no find the sum of a series? Like telescoping 
Michael Lu: Probably not, just tests for convergence 
Kimberly Lu: oh okie 
Michael Lu: His tests are too short to fit spiral questions 
Kimberly Lu: i really hope so 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Kimberly Lu: Wait you call old question spiral questions? ð 
Michael Lu: Yah ð 
Kimberly Lu: lol nerd terminology jk 
Michael Lu: Wot no adopted from Mr. Chugh 
Kimberly Lu: What really?? I didn't even remember that Wait I have a question to ask you About one of the hw questions 
Michael Lu: Ya 
Kimberly Lu: For #30, how did he go from 2+ (-1)^k/5^k To 3/5^k+1 Oh wait never mind i am dumb For the limit comparison test, how do you know what to choose for the series you use to compare with? Like do you just generally find something that has similar leading terms? 
Michael Lu: Yah, it's very similar to choosing series in the regular comparison test But you don't have to include a which is greater or less 
Kimberly Lu: The only thing is that you have to try to get it to cancel to 1? 
Michael Lu: Cancel to get a finite number > 0 
Kimberly Lu: Ohh When you come up with a series to compare with, do you randomly choose. One or do you think ahead and make sure it cancels to finite positive number? Like how you do it personally 
Michael Lu: TBH I didn't think ahead on the HW bc it told u to do the limit comparison :( 
Kimberly Lu: LOL okay so basically you just pick something close to the original series and hope for. The best 
Michael Lu: Yah, if he lets u use ur calc u could probably plug it in 
Kimberly Lu: Ohh true thats a good idea Alrighty thanks michael! 
Michael Lu: Np! 


Conversation:
Kimberly Lu: Do you remember how to justify the answer for this question? 
Michael Lu: Cheat way: use the range equation provided in the lab. Not cheat way: horizontal and vertical velocity components double So The air time doubles (vf = vi + a * t, 0 = 2 * vi + a * (2 * t)) And since the horizontal velocity and air time both double the range quadruples (d = 2 * v * 2 * t) 
Kimberly Lu: ohh and then just plug into Dx = Vxt? 
Michael Lu: Yah 
Kimberly Lu: wait wasn't the answer the range is less than doubles though? 
Michael Lu: I thought it was more, what does google say? 
Kimberly Lu: oh darn really i forgot wait why does it more than double if t only doubles oh wait because vx also doubles 
Michael Lu: Yah 
Kimberly Lu: ohhhhhh okay thanks michael!! 
Michael Lu: Np 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: How does graham grade his guides? 
Kimberly Lu: believe it or not graham never gave us back the guides not one 
Michael Lu: So... like you never found out if he graded it? Did you have to print it out? 
Kimberly Lu: yeah we never got to see the grade uh I think so... We handed in a paper copy and on turnitin 
Michael Lu: Oke 


Conversation:
Kimberly Lu: Did you get the math bonus question? 
Michael Lu: I think so 
Kimberly Lu: Did you get 0.98 less than equal to x less than equal to 1.02? Or 0.737 less than equal to x less than equal to 1.303 
Michael Lu: 0.737 and 1.303 
Kimberly Lu: ah okay thanks michael 


Conversation:
Kimberly Lu: Can you send me the math notes from today? 
Michael Lu: You'll probably get better notes from other ppl

Conversation:
Michael Lu: Kimbo what is graham's grading for essays like? 
Kimberly Lu: oh you don't even know no es bueno mi amigo 
Michael Lu: :(((((((( does he give B's and C'a to everyone 
Kimberly Lu: how are you doing in his class? it's not that bad right 
Michael Lu: A- depends on this in class essay. It's one of those two day computer lab essays 
Kimberly Lu: I'm sure you're fine litty we never did computer lab essays 
Michael Lu: :/ 
Kimberly Lu: last year he gave us a take-home black boy essay 
Michael Lu: Oh what that's OP 
Kimberly Lu: no it was pretty bad he graded it harshly i think in-class essays are better because he grades more leniently 
Michael Lu: ð what happened 
Kimberly Lu: it brought my quarter grade down to A- 
Michael Lu: Oh darn does he not give A's on essays? 
Kimberly Lu: he does, but he's very picky lmao 
Michael Lu: :( 


Conversation:
Kimberly Lu: is there a proof for a = v2/R? or did mr wells just give us that? 
Michael Lu: Given 
Kimberly Lu: wait how did you do #3? you did it patrick's way? 
Michael Lu: Umm Idk what that is He doesnât have the acceleration Oh wait Nvm 
Kimberly Lu: doesn't that acceleration seem really large 
Michael Lu: Itâs acceleration 
Kimberly Lu: 7 m/s2??? 
Michael Lu: g is 9.8 
Kimberly Lu: how high up did you start the pendulum 
Michael Lu: Idk man :/ 
Kimberly Lu: hmm Does this way make sense too? 
Michael Lu: Wait where did u get the tension from 
Kimberly Lu: the force sensor max force 
Michael Lu: Ok Legit 
Kimberly Lu: so this way should work too? i literally did it both ways and the numbers came out diff 
Michael Lu: :/ Did you finish studying for maths? Is the continuity and differentiability on the test? I thought that was the last unit. 
Kimberly Lu: yes it is there s a theorme 
Michael Lu: ð what theorem 
Kimberly Lu: if f(x) is diff at Xo, it is also cont at Xo 
Michael Lu: Oh dear is that on the test? 
Kimberly Lu: probably? idk 


Conversation:
Kimberly Lu: So the topic for chem lab this yr is thermodynamics and physical properties Lab at Islip was calorimetry and Princeton is probably that too you know how to do that right? 
Michael Lu: Like calorimeter ? 
Kimberly Lu: yeah the coffee cup thingie 
Michael Lu: What about it 
Kimberly Lu: just mix a compound into water and coffe cup measure temp change record masses and temp change that's it 
Michael Lu: Oh ok 
Kimberly Lu: and then calculate heat of rxn 
Michael Lu: Woah Do we get notes 
Kimberly Lu: and entropy and Enthalpy and Gibbs free energy yeah we get 4 double sided sheets or 5 
Michael Lu: Cool beans ð¥ð¥ð¥ 
Kimberly Lu: I'll share the cheat sheets with you worst comes to worst you can just take the lab data and I'll do the rest 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Kimberly Lu: mlu1? 
Michael Lu: Yah 
Kimberly Lu: ok just shared it you can add stuff if you want one of the pages is half empty so you can put notes there if you want lol if it's not calorimetry we screwed maybe it'll be density orrrr freezing point and boiling point depression like you add stuff into a solution and the boiling point and freezing point decrease oh also The notes about gases are from last yr not this year's topic so you don't need to know them 


Conversation:
Kimberly Lu: We medaled in chem lab? 
Michael Lu: Yeah lol I have ur medal Remind me tuesdoor

Conversation:
Kimberly Lu: Did you save any of Mr. Dicksonâs answer keys for the tests? 
Michael Lu: No sry :/ 
Kimberly Lu: it's okay dw Do you know how to do 3b? 
Michael Lu: Arcsine canât get an input greater than 1 or less than -1 So if u put 1/x x has to be a value that makes 1/x between -1 and 1 Or equal to -1 or 1 That means the denominator x can be 1 or greater or -1 or less so x can be (-inf, -1] U [1, inf) 
Kimberly Lu: ohh thanks

Michael Lu: LOL aight kimbo 


Conversation:
Kimberly Lu: how do 
Michael Lu: lemme see it's Tnet = Ia and net torque is caused by gravity on the center of mass of beam and moment of inertia is 1/3 mr^2 
Kimberly Lu: oh m cancels out? 
Michael Lu: yeah should be 
Kimberly Lu: lol it didn't work I just don't get what to use the angle for 
Michael Lu: the radius must be perpendicular to force if gravity points straight down (vertically) then the perpendicular radius component to that is the adjacent side (cos(theta) * radius) 
Kimberly Lu: Lol what you said makes sense but I'm probably dumb or calculated wrong bc still doesn't work 
Michael Lu: 7.92? 
Kimberly Lu: IT WORKED whatt how gsin41 = 1/3(.7)(alpha)? 
Michael Lu: 0.7 * cos(41) * 9.8 * m = (1/3) * 1.4^2 * alpha how did u do moment of inertia in there 
Kimberly Lu: ohh I used 0.7 instead of 1.4 lol thanks!!

Conversation:
Michael Lu: Kimbo What r ur tips on college apps What did u write abt for sips and essays stuff? 
Kimberly Lu: hi litty sorry i gotta go somewhere rn but i'll text u when i get back home !! also ask ur sister lmao she's the og best college apps writer LOLLLL tell emma I like her hat emma got a haircut?! LOL *thinks for a few seconds* ... "huh?" hmm for college sups, i kinda took an approach that was diff from emmaâs. for prompts that asked âwhy this college,â i spent most of the essay talking specifically about what i would envision myself doing at that college and linking it to my accomplishments/awards/credentials. for example, iâd say âAs a Co-Author of two cancer pharmacology papers (one being published in Cellular Physiology and Biochemistry) and a Siemens Science Competition Semifinalist who aspires to become an oncologist-scientist, I see Cornell Universityâs College of Agriculture and Life Sciences as my first choice for college for its Biology and Society major and the opportunity to participate as an undergraduate in cutting-edge research.â then iâd go on to talk about what specific courses iâd be excited to take and why, potential minors, research labs iâd want to join, clubs, sports, orchestra, etc., linking everything to what i did in high school. basically, i just used sups as an opportunity to elaborate on my extracurriculars and talk more in depth about stuff i put on my common app for my common app essay, i talked about my experience of saving someone's life at a restaurant with my dad (who's an er doctor) and my reflections about how it was a major turning point in my life about wanting to be a doctor (LOL i was targeting the medical programs so my common app essay and extracurriculars were all very medical heavy) 
Michael Lu: Si oke thxxx!! 
Kimberly Lu: mhm np!! lmk if u have any other questions 
Michael Lu: Yup 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Olah When colleges ask u why u like meds What was ur response Qot qot qot 
Kimberly Lu: are you talking about med programs? or pre-med cuz u should answer differently based which one 
Michael Lu: Lol idk what the diff is 
Kimberly Lu: med program is BS/MD like 4 yrs undergrad, go straight to med school without having to do med school apps pre-med is just a track for undergraduate colleges u still have to apply to med school basically if u get accepted into a BS/MD program, u have acceptance to an undergrad and medical school at once

Michael Lu: No 
Kimberly Lu: okay you'll get it then 
Michael Lu: O lol 
Kimberly Lu: ya U have to wear it at graduation 
Michael Lu: O Ew 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: What was ur graduation speech abt And whyâd u choose that topic 
Kimberly Lu: my speech was kind of more general rather than on a specific topic it was about how graduation is like a watershed moment I talked about reflecting on the past and looking forward towards the future it's online if u want to read it but it's pretty cheesy bc it was rushed ð u should do one with humor I feel like a speech with a lot of humor suits u

Kristin Hon: Hello What's up? 
Michael Lu: Can you do me a webassign favor? 
Kristin Hon: Sure? Canât guarantee anything tho 
Michael Lu: Okay. Open up the newest assignment and go to question 14. 
Kristin Hon: And choose answer choice?? 
Michael Lu: Send me your numbers. Try 16.86 for part A 
Kristin Hon: Kk Itâs correct 
Michael Lu: 1.7 for part B? 
Kristin Hon: Incorrect 
Michael Lu: Hmmm Lol no idea then XD Thx tho Kristin! 
Kristin Hon: Np Sorry I couldnât help 
Michael Lu: Itâs fine I just needed to test something. 
Kristin Hon: Okay 
Michael Lu: Hi Kristin, try 1.7 again. Wells said it was an error in the answer key. Thx for helping me tho! 
Kristin Hon: Oh Kk 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Kristin hi Could you help me for questions 2 and 3 of the lab I wasnât able to ask well today in school 
Kristin Hon: I think for 3 possible error was the Ammeter reading we touched upon that briefly the other day 
Michael Lu: Yeah got that 
Kristin Hon: I couldnât rlly think of anything else for that question beyond human error b/c internal resistance of wires plays into the v terminal I think that was actually the answer to 2 now that Iâm looking at it If I find anything else out Iâll let you know J got back from a meet so I didnât get to complete the lab yet 
Michael Lu: K thx Kristin! 
Kristin Hon: Np sorry I couldnât help more rn 
Michael Lu: Itâs fine mristinin ! 
Kristin Hon: ?? Kristintin?? 
Michael Lu: Kristin*! 
Kristin Hon: Lol Okayyy For 2. Resistance of wires donât matter since they are part of external circuit. Therefore they are j a part of the variable resistance that we are using to find I of circuit as a whole We are looking at Vterminal=EMF-IR(battery) so actual value of R external doesnât matter 3. Battery can drain if you use it too much (EMF decreases) or not precise tools cuz there is a limit on the meter settings also, the meters round Also, if you ask me abt 5 I have no idea. Iâve been asked abt it and I think Iâm going to go with yes since Kirchhoff loop of each battery in series needs to be 0V Pls let me know if my explanations are baseless and unwarranted...(*warning: they tend to be) 
Michael Lu: K thx Kirstin! 
Kristin Hon: Np

Michael Lu: Have a surface book with autodesk inventor student license 
Laura Li: ok did that help at all p 
Michael Lu: Yeah Iâll check out the fishbowl thing 
Laura Li: uwu 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: hullo u r a mech E and ur smart ^dimensions in drawing are in inches my friend wants to build a wooden shed with 2x4 wood studs (they're rlly 1.5" by 3.5" studs) do u think that the frame is too thin or that there's too much empty space for the wood to flex under it's own weight? Is this thingy structurally sound or will the man die under the shed :\ 
Laura Li: whatâs going on top of the frame like is there going to be a roof 
Michael Lu: Maybe like 5 pounds just on the overhanging section 
Laura Li: also he needs diagonal trusses for sure 
Michael Lu: Aigh aigh Just one diagonal per side? 
Laura Li: if he builds it like that on the top then the load of the top studs is going to fall on the fasteners (screws) not the wood so itâs very unlikely that the wood will flex. more likely that the 4 vertical beams will rotate perpendicular to the fasteners adding diagonal truss will solve that itâs cool tho 
Michael Lu: What abt just moving the top studs to rest on top of the 84â stud posts Even tho idk how to fasten them 
Laura Li: sure but then the fastening is harder yeah 
Michael Lu: So the diagonal trusses are fasted to the vertical 84â posts but physically support the top studs? 
Laura Li: no they just stop the verticals from wanting to rotate they can also support the posts you can also calculate if the screws will be able to take the load 
Michael Lu: ð® how do^ 
Laura Li: my instinct is telling me that if he uses wood screws that are long enough then the top should be fine wait are you home 
Michael Lu: Yes quite home rn 
Laura Li: sorry iâm lazy and donât like typing ok i can just come talk to u about it 
Michael Lu: Yes that work Where

Michael Lu: Yes old and refurbished 
Lenny Meng: Try turning it on without the battery in? But have it plugged in 
Michael Lu: Is plugged in rn 
Lenny Meng: Yeah, have it plugged in but without the battery Then try turning it on 
Michael Lu: Lemm try to access the battery 
Lenny Meng: Aight, keep me updated 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Lenny Meng: Oh rip 
Michael Lu: Internal battery? Must start unscrewing stuff? 
Lenny Meng: Was there any water spilled or was it just a random shutoff? 
Michael Lu: Either It ran out of battery due to uncharged Yeah thatâs it Lol 
Lenny Meng: Ah lmao 
Michael Lu: Maybe leave it in overnight? 
Lenny Meng: Yeah, I would try that 
Michael Lu: Itâs been charging for an hour 
Lenny Meng: oh 
Michael Lu: More 
Lenny Meng: I would leave it on overnight If it still doesn't work by morning, I would start unscrewing and trying to power on without the battery (but because the battery is internal idk how the circuitry works out) 
Michael Lu: You can never trust maca MacBooks 
Lenny Meng: lmaooo My guess is that the genius bar isn't going to be too trustworthy these days xD 
Michael Lu: Aight thx for help Lenny! Iâll lyk 
Lenny Meng: Np :) aight 
Michael Lu: Battery or hard drive? Didnât turn on Battery still in Going take it out 
Lenny Meng: Hey sorry was outside Uhh that looks like the hard drive I don't see a battery (It's usually thin and rectangular) There's one last thing you can try which is unplugging, then hold the power button to drain the excess in the system If it still doesn't work, and there's no way to get to the battery, you might have to get a new one But you can still save your files, just swap the hard drives out 
Michael Lu: ð lol 
Lenny Meng: Haha yeah 
Michael Lu: Battery is stuck underneath back plate Pain in the ass to remove 
Lenny Meng: Ohh that sucks Yeah don't try removing it in that case They might've done some fiddling with the battery like saughtering it 
Michael Lu: Nah itâs ok to remove the battery 
Lenny Meng: Ah aight 
Michael Lu: Once I put the apple sicker on it became harder to take apart 
Lenny Meng: LOL 
Michael Lu: If I remove the hard drive How would I access the stuff What cable 
Lenny Meng: SATA 
Michael Lu: is there a SATA to usb 
Lenny Meng: But you would just replace the hard drive in another compiter Yeah you could do SATA to USB But there's not really a huge need for it You can replace the hard drive of another computer with your laptop's, then upload to drive/USB But I'm not sure if laptops and desktops use the same connection Older desktops use IDE Yep, left side is SATA The L shaped one 
Michael Lu: What abt the right 
Lenny Meng: Uhhh believe that's IDE? Im pretty sure it's not used for anything but I'll double check 
Michael Lu: But I can use either? The laptop has a port for both 
Lenny Meng: Ohh wait no The L one on the left is SATA for data transger The right one is SATA Power 
Michael Lu: So How would I sata to usb this 
Lenny Meng: You would need to buy an enclosure on Amazon Those things aren't cheap xD 
Michael Lu: Lol could u send a link 
Lenny Meng: Sure *NVM Encolsures aren't cheap but the wire is Uhhh Not sure how to send link I'll send screenshot Okay nvm that doesn't work eithet

Matthew Chen: Rip It's hard to break 1500 Or harder than people think 
Michael Lu: i'm close on the practice tests but english is a dick 
Matthew Chen: Um did u do the 7 collegboard ones I mean 8 
Michael Lu: yeah doing those 
Matthew Chen: Finish them 
Michael Lu: i try the reading is so BS tho what did you do to prepare for reading? practice? 
Matthew Chen: Yeah I wrote on all the library books And just practiced strategies 
Michael Lu: dam how much wrong per passage do you avg? 
Matthew Chen: To try to get 1500 I usually get 2 wrong Total 
Michael Lu: dafuq u srs? 
Matthew Chen: Yeah 
Michael Lu: damm does 11 AP help? 
Matthew Chen: Very I'd say it helped me sweep reading But that was probably luck What I was saying earlier is that to optimize your score try to sweep writing 
Michael Lu: which dates did you take the test and did your score improve a lot (from your first practice test) 
Matthew Chen: PSAT I got 1300 My first collegeboard test was two months after I got 1420 Each time I improved by 20-30 points I just worked my ass off on writing And reading just improves with a lot of practice 
Michael Lu: writing meaning essay or grammar? 
Matthew Chen: Grammar 
Michael Lu: k grammar's okay for me but reading is just BS 
Matthew Chen: Essay is really pointless after 6/6/6 nobody cares 
Michael Lu: lol 
Matthew Chen: Well how many are you getting wrong More than 1 or 2 is easy points you're giving up Cause there's no curve for writing 
Michael Lu: grammar i get 3 -5 wrong total in last 3 tests 
Matthew Chen: Close enough 
Michael Lu: bc careless or BS questions but reading i just get slaughtered 
Matthew Chen: That's what I got on the real thing How do So Which kinds 
Michael Lu: so you swept reading, but not grammar? 
Matthew Chen: No I had 3 wrong And math was a 790 whoops I am a hypocrite lmao 
Michael Lu: yeah math is so pointless but it's hard to get perfect score if you don't pay attention 
Matthew Chen: I zoned out I had no idea where I messed up on cause after reading and grammar my brain gave up 
Michael Lu: yo did you just self study for the SAT 4 months? 
Matthew Chen: I did 
Michael Lu: how much studying per day? 
Matthew Chen: Hour or two Maybe less actually 
Michael Lu: lmao wat ur just smart? 
Matthew Chen: Eew no 
Michael Lu: yo what did other ppl get? 
Matthew Chen: Shawn kang got 1560 Patrick Shen got 1500 Most smart ppl in our grade got above 1500 But some people are so sus ð 
Michael Lu: sam tello? 1520 
Matthew Chen: Yeah Idk 
Michael Lu: what did weiting get? 
Matthew Chen: 1590 Or 80 
Michael Lu: YO WTF dafuq english ain't even his first language 
Matthew Chen: lol technically he's not better Need 40 point difference I'm just salty lmao 
Michael Lu: what about annie zhang? 
Matthew Chen: Idk 
Michael Lu: adrian? 
Matthew Chen: You could ask them 
Michael Lu: nah they're not nice 
Matthew Chen: Ik 
Michael Lu: jessica jiangs? 
Matthew Chen: I'd assume around my score Yuhan as well 
Michael Lu: so i should aim for mid to high 1500s i guess 
Matthew Chen: Well anything above 1530 is elite nationally Actually more than elite Cornell average is 1490 ish 
Michael Lu: y'aint i got 3 weeks 
Matthew Chen: Not even 15 
Michael Lu: yah but cornell is a cc of ivy's probably the safety for most of your grade 
Matthew Chen: I'm earlying there 
Michael Lu: yeet GL man 
Matthew Chen: And don't fucking call it a safety I'm getting triggered lol 
Michael Lu: lol i quoth the ajay 
Matthew Chen: So how bad is reading for you 
Michael Lu: what dates did u choose for the SAT? 
Matthew Chen: How many wrong I chose march For the real one Because I was like fuck it 
Michael Lu: did you take a second one? 
Matthew Chen: Nah 
Michael Lu: dam that's skill 
Matthew Chen: Oh yeah Asia got 1520 My mom told me on WeChat She was comparing peoples scores She was like what's your score did you get 1500 
Michael Lu: lol ok for reading i get like 0 - 2 wrong on practice tests but sometimes the passage is so BS i get like 4 wrong, especially when they're the supporting evidence paired question sets 
Matthew Chen: In total? Oh yeah I hate those paired evidence shits You get one wrong usually the other one is too 
Michael Lu: yeah. it sucks my first practice test i got 11 wrong it was brutal but i've gotten it down to 8 
Matthew Chen: Hmm 
Michael Lu: but there's usually a BS passage that causes half the wrong answers do you answer and read at the same time? 
Matthew Chen: I read first Because context matters for those questions 
Michael Lu: true yo where do you get the practice tho, i ran out of khan academy 
Matthew Chen: Kaplan Princeton McGraw hill is best 
Michael Lu: k is it just practice practice practice for reading at this point 
Matthew Chen: Yes As much as possible Check books out man LOL It looks ok actually 
Michael Lu: whatever still buying barrons 
Matthew Chen: I think the real reason of psat To scare people to buy collegrboard books lol 
Michael Lu: yo fax 
Matthew Chen: Barron's will do Any legit practice will tbh 
Michael Lu: is 1500 - 1550 good enough for ivy's if ur asian (besides cornell)? 
Matthew Chen: Yeah 1550? Tf 1500 is 99th already From then on it's just Asian vs Asian vs the occasional non Asian dude 
Michael Lu: lmao dam so 1490 is decent for 2nd practice test? 
Matthew Chen: 1490 is like the cliff mentality You have the intelligence and skill But you need the right mentality Like if you're getting stuff wrong it's always for a reason even tho it might seem like bs 
Michael Lu: does the mentality come with practice? 
Matthew Chen: Somewhat, but you know how most people do practice like leisurely Idk something just snapped test day Oh yeH it really helps if you go in the morning with a book or something and do a set of reading questions Don't look at the answers just do a set 
Michael Lu: ok wait, did your practice tests resemble your actual test scores? 
Matthew Chen: Plus or minus 30 More plus though 
Michael Lu: dam u got 1590s??? 
Matthew Chen: Lolllll no Highest I got in practice was 1550 
Michael Lu: oh i see 
Matthew Chen: Lowest was 1490 So everything went right but you should probably expect something around there Unless you bust out in reading 
Michael Lu: dam u the man ur gonna be my junior year messiah 
Matthew Chen: Or am I 
Michael Lu: lol ur smart but you ain't a condescending asshole 
Matthew Chen: What about Ethan Wang who watches Game Of Trash 
Michael Lu: he a scrub 
Matthew Chen: Yee 
Michael Lu: aight, thx for the wisdom 
Matthew Chen: I had an outline due like a week ago And I haven't started Dr hersh is gonna kill me come September 
Michael Lu: RIP 
Matthew Chen: U me and Ethan After our reset arch We're dragging u to karaeoke 
Michael Lu: Dafuq ok... yo i got dickson pd 8 
Matthew Chen: shedrow never responded to my email so i'm appealing to chugh 
Michael Lu: lol 
Matthew Chen: i heard from ethan wang you guys trolled him hard 
Michael Lu: don't they both basically hate u 
Matthew Chen: yeah so my chances are pretty slim can i just talk to erikson

Michael Lu: get it 9th and it's basically a free period 
Matthew Chen: Does comp sci have tests tho Like I want A's 
Michael Lu: not for weisswange i think 
Matthew Chen: And I'm kinda trash 
Michael Lu: but he might 
Matthew Chen: Yeah I'm not taking that chance 
Michael Lu: weisse is the chill one 
Matthew Chen: Unless you can confirm That I pull easy A 
Michael Lu: well there's a lot less work with weisse than with zinn 
Matthew Chen: Because I'm horrible at programming Doesn't matter I suck at tests I got 80's in zinn So Yeah Weiss gives twsts 
Michael Lu: sux 
Matthew Chen: anyway my schedule isn't final yet depending on whether chugh 
Michael Lu: k get that rec my man 
Matthew Chen: it would seriously suck to not take BC i should have switched out of shedrow Oh well John replied Lmaooooooo What did he say Did he talk to u Hey Would you consider helping me come up with my senior name/pic 
Michael Lu: lol i can help with the name if i think of one but if you want a pic ur getting a microsoft paint job 
Matthew Chen: I was thinking the great matsby R U willing to help tho 
Michael Lu: that'[s legit what do you need? 
Matthew Chen: A legit Microsoft paint job Cause idk how to do that stuff 
Michael Lu: ur better off getting somebody to use photoshop unless you want the microsoft paint quality 
Matthew Chen: I'll think about it Thanks tho 
Michael Lu: np lmk 
Matthew Chen: Ok it's done It turned out quite well

Conversation:
Michael Lu: hey A student drove to the university from her home and noted that the odometer on her car increased by 15.0 km. The trip took 16.0 min.
(a) What was her average speed?
 
56.25
 
Correct: Your answer is correct.
 km/h 
(b) If the straight-line distance from her home to the university is 10.3 km in a direction 25.0Â° south of east, what was her average velocity?
 
38.625
 
Correct: Your answer is correct.
 km/h (25Â° S of E) 
(c) If she returned home by the same path 7 h 30 min after she left, what were her average speed and velocity for the entire trip?
average speed PART C help 
Matthew Chen: are you seriously asking me for help on webass 
Michael Lu: yes] bc part c is retareded 
Matthew Chen: allow me to show you the door i'm doing my own webass rn 
Michael Lu: mook 
Matthew Chen: avg spped is diff from velocity just use the definitions 
Michael Lu: no duh but gimme the answer 
Matthew Chen: avg velocity is zero duh as for speed i'm sure you can figure out 
Michael Lu: IM ASKING FOR SPEED bc the question is poorly worded and i don't know what numbers to use 
Matthew Chen: speed is total time i believe so i think if you're not getting this right you didn't add the 7 hours 30 minutes 
Michael Lu: which distance do i use? 20.6 or 30? dafuq the answer is 4 
Matthew Chen: makes sense 
Michael Lu: whatever wells 
Matthew Chen: i used 30 
Michael Lu: yeah but they gave me two distances and multiple times like wtf i don't know which one to use 
Matthew Chen: they gave u straight line and travelled use the one the person travelled 
Michael Lu: yeah but 10.3 or 15? 
Matthew Chen: 15 
Michael Lu: okay 
Matthew Chen: how do you know the anwer before you solved the question

Michael Lu: No I'm asking 
Matthew Chen: I think so 
Michael Lu: U mooking? Bo Yang said no 
Matthew Chen: Do u mean differentiation Of trig functions 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Matthew Chen: Oh lol no 
Michael Lu: Oh lol 
Matthew Chen: I just Wikipediaed it in shedrow 
Michael Lu: Lmao worth Good call 
Matthew Chen: Ik I probably can't help u thi Because I have pretty limited knowledge Like I know the derivd 
Michael Lu: Nah I'm good I finished the hw 
Matthew Chen: I'm doing it now 
Michael Lu: Okay 
Matthew Chen: I need confirmation for number 20 
Michael Lu: Use your cas U mook 
Matthew Chen: Oh yeahhhh Tf  am I smoking Oh shitttt This has limits???? Yo this calc is rigged actually op 
Michael Lu: Fax 
Matthew Chen: Literally if I had a cas last year How do u do notation For left and right tho Does it know if u put the sign 
Michael Lu: You don't need to It's infinity How tf do you approach it from the right? 
Matthew Chen: Number 20? 
Michael Lu: Oh it doesn't matter They assume the limit exists So just leave the direction blank 
Matthew Chen: W o w Amazing It was zero after all 
Michael Lu: Lol when in doubt 0 
Matthew Chen: Wait not all of these use hospital 
Michael Lu: Did u get infinity for 12 Wdym 
Matthew Chen: That's the one I haven't done Actually I'm doing it rn 
Michael Lu: Use your cas What does it say 
Matthew Chen: Yes Infinity 
Michael Lu: Cool 
Matthew Chen: I suspected Because both r growing to infinity 
Michael Lu: Now I can go to sleep XD 
Matthew Chen: But exponential Grows faster? 
Michael Lu: Yah but you gotta differentiate 
Matthew Chen: :/ 
Michael Lu: Or else it's indeterminate 
Matthew Chen: Disgusting Wait it's e You don't have to diff 
Michael Lu: Yeah but you gotta dif the bottom Until it's a constant 
Matthew Chen: Wouldn't it turn to 2? 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Matthew Chen: Why do u say diff isn't it derive 
Michael Lu: Differentiate? 
Matthew Chen: Yeah 
Michael Lu: Differentiation Derive is like algebraically proving/obtaining 
Matthew Chen: Oh I think I interchange the terms

Conversation:
Matthew Chen: Hey scruv I have a calc q to ask you 
Michael Lu: I'm actually trying to go to sleep but okay what 
Matthew Chen: So you know the Absolute convergence test Why does Dickson make you do ratio test right after Is that the test itself 
Michael Lu: He doesn't The ratio test is separate 
Matthew Chen: So it's part of the test? Then why do ratio test 
Michael Lu: Only if the thingy diverges The ratio test is one of the few options you have to test out the original series 
Matthew Chen: So if you do Absolute convergence test and you get it diverges, you have to do some other test to test for convergence? Oh ok 
Michael Lu: Yes Either ratio or alternating 
Matthew Chen: This is for series with negative terms right 
Michael Lu: Yes 
Matthew Chen: Thanks Idk why you pretending to sleep tho when u on fb 
Michael Lu: I'm gonna sleep but u and john Wong asking me questions 
Matthew Chen: Oh lol johnny boy There's no conditional divergent right 
Michael Lu: No 
Matthew Chen: It's either Absolute both or conditionally convergent 
Michael Lu: Yes 
Matthew Chen: And conditional convergence only happens if og series converges but Absolute series diverges 
Michael Lu: Yes 
Matthew Chen: Ohhh that's why u do ratio to test for conditional stuff 
Michael Lu: Yes 
Matthew Chen: Aight icic tyvm 
Michael Lu: Yes

Matthew Chen: Can u pull arcsin out of limit Is that legal

Matthew Chen: pg 160 number 19 i guess what do we need to know regarding  inverse functions? 
Michael Lu: chapter 2.6 
Matthew Chen: Ok 
Michael Lu: I guess if the limit inside arcsine is within arcsine's range then you could pull it out, idk ask mr dickson 
Matthew Chen: Yeah it works Pulling out gets the right answer 
Michael Lu: doesn't mean it always works

Matthew Chen: I remember two had passages. One was open ended 
Michael Lu: Synthesis is like DBQ So what do for last one? What âevidenceâ 
Matthew Chen: Logic, personal experience, or using a novel I think I used a novel for mine 
Michael Lu: Dam I guess novel is safest bet If itâs philosophical Did Hastings prep u for all 3 essays? And MC or were u mainly self study? Also can I use history? 
Matthew Chen: Probably Hastings prepped a lot for the AP She guarantees you a 4 pretty much And a 5 is not hard to get if you take her class Her class is really AP geared English was one of the ones I didnât study much for 
Michael Lu: Fuq Ok Dam ur like One of the few ppl who got a 5? 
Matthew Chen: Really 
Michael Lu: Idk 
Matthew Chen: I thought getting a 5 was pretty easy 
Michael Lu: Are u 
Matthew Chen: Idk 
Michael Lu: Donât u ask other ppl what they got? 
Matthew Chen: No Iâm not that toxic 
Michael Lu: Lol ok 
Matthew Chen: Youâll probably do well I would just practice outlining essays And just reading all the past released prompts 
Michael Lu: Yup

Matthew Chen: Hand cramps were 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Matthew Chen: Nah everyone thinks timing is an issue but I finished like 10 min early 
Michael Lu: Wtf 
Matthew Chen: In AP lit ppl were legit asleep An hour into the essays ppl put their head down lol 
Michael Lu: Well thatâs lit not Lang right 
Matthew Chen: Yeah but Lang is not that hard Itâs the MC honestly That will make or break 
Michael Lu: Rlly? 
Matthew Chen: Yeah 
Michael Lu: U said aim for 80%? 
Matthew Chen: Honestly 75% will get the job done 
Michael Lu: Aight cool Ainât too bad 
Matthew Chen: I mean you could probably get 15 wrong on MC Average an 8 And pull a 5 easy Dw bout percentages simply get 100 And youâll get a 5

Matthew Chen: Not really More of a meme tbh So are you asking me about other ppl or about yourself Stop worrying about your competition lol 
Michael Lu: Lol whoâs competitive? 
Matthew Chen: Iâll tell you that essays are def make break for you 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Matthew Chen: Iâm not sure about other stuff, leadership stuff is fake anyway You can exaggerate and get away with it 
Michael Lu: You got rejected from Columbia but accepted to Cornell 
Matthew Chen: I EDâd Cornell my dude 
Michael Lu: Did u apply to anywhere else Oh Did u ED Columbia? 
Matthew Chen: You canât ED 2 schools Only one 
Michael Lu: O So then what was Columbia for u 
Matthew Chen: Maybe a transfer option Premed is the same everywhere 
Michael Lu: U do premed? 
Matthew Chen: Cornellâs is good enough Mhm 
Michael Lu: Dafuq ok 
Matthew Chen: What do you want out of. Your school First of all Clout? Environment? 
Michael Lu: Which college of Cornell did u apply? 
Matthew Chen: Arts/sci 
Michael Lu: Aight aight 
Matthew Chen: Which is  8% rate Not too hard to get into 
Michael Lu: Lol good one 
Matthew Chen: You could probably get in 
Michael Lu: For regular? 
Matthew Chen: Tbh not sure why our val didnât Most likely 
Michael Lu: Dam like why did so many people get cucked Was Weiting international? 
Matthew Chen: Yeah Still got brown and stern Not bad 
Michael Lu: Brown? 
Matthew Chen: Better than 99% of people 
Michael Lu: But like UPenn 
Matthew Chen: Upenn is an ivy That loves connections and money Itâs difficult to get in without either 
Michael Lu: So that library person 
Matthew Chen: Mhm 
Michael Lu: What abt volk 
Matthew Chen: Penn is for rich white business ppl Idk volkâs stats I assume he was somewhat competitive 
Michael Lu: He was hella legacy I heard 
Matthew Chen: F I suggest you ED Columbia tbh 
Michael Lu: Nah man 
Matthew Chen: Youâre going for Stan/harvard? 
Michael Lu: I ainât gonna be one of ur pawns 
Matthew Chen: Lol aight 
Michael Lu: Preferably stan But like Eh 
Matthew Chen: Interesting 
Michael Lu: If I get rejected from stan ED 
Matthew Chen: Stan will take 2-3 
Michael Lu: then I canât get in 
Matthew Chen: Stan is EA 
Michael Lu: Oh shit my b 
Matthew Chen: Yeah thatâs the rip part If Stan rejects you Which is very likely 
Michael Lu: So like you donât have to commit EA 
Matthew Chen: No 
Michael Lu: Why Stan hates Asian stem boy? 
Matthew Chen: But RD is harder Idk They love girls RD is much harder The ivies kinda converge 
Michael Lu: Dammmm 
Matthew Chen: To sub 8 acceptance Even Cornell 
Michael Lu: Is Cornell like 
Matthew Chen: Iâm serious tho when I ask what you look for 
Michael Lu: Soft in our school? 
Matthew Chen: Cornell loves our school So acceptance is inflated here 
Michael Lu: Ok Wdym what I look for 
Matthew Chen: Are you looking for a purely intellectual environment? Or cause Stan is Comp sci If youâre applying comp sci Iâm gonna give you my condolences now 
Michael Lu: Idk if I should apply for comp sci and turn into Yuhan 
Matthew Chen: Yuhan is empirically A better candidate than you But essay wise Idk Stats only go so far Among the top 15 
Michael Lu: How much of your career path do you have to disclose? 
Matthew Chen: Wdym career path 
Michael Lu: Like can I just be vague in my STEM passion without declaring comp sci as a major? 
Matthew Chen: Being vague could be worse 
Michael Lu: Y 
Matthew Chen: Because then youâd kinda be lumped with a general category No differentiation Best to find a spike And capitalize on that spike 
Michael Lu: Yeah the spike is still STEM 
Matthew Chen: Also idk why youâre asking me this I didnât get anywhere good lol 
Michael Lu: Itâs not like Iâm going in âwell-roundedâ Lol who did get anywhere good? 
Matthew Chen: Stem by itself is still incredibly diverse My girlfriend? 
Michael Lu: Idgaf about girls 
Matthew Chen: You probably should 
Michael Lu: Theyâre experience is skewed by STEM girl preference 
Matthew Chen: True and sheâs a liberal arts major But UChicago is no joke Also she took like 1 AP class so essays def matter a lot 
Michael Lu: What Asian boys in your grade made it far? 
Matthew Chen: And ECs Maybe Eric thatâs it Everyone else is in the 10-15 range But comparing the school as a whole is not a gold comparison Good Cornell A&S is much better than itâs state stuff And Wharton carries penn 
Michael Lu: Did anybody go for Cornell engineering? 
Matthew Chen: Many applied, only Shawn got in 
Michael Lu: Holy crap 
Matthew Chen: For arts and sciences maybe only me and Devin? Oh Kelly foo Thatâs it I think? Everyone else did Cals Or Dyson 
Michael Lu: What are they planning to transfer? 
Matthew Chen: I suggest you donât care wonât rankings so much About* 
Michael Lu: Whatâs ranking 
Matthew Chen: College rankings Many ppl are too clout obsessed Just pick a school you like And tbh I think more people should consider UChicago itâs basically a nerd school Whatever good luck applying to Stan I suggest you have a few backup schools ready 
Michael Lu: Lol many people should consider UChicago because they dropped the SAT requirement 
Matthew Chen: It still looks and bad Everyone will submit anyway ol And regardless uchig is a liberal arts school Not many ppl apply anyway to a niche school So have you considered what to do if you donât get into Stan Cause that gonna happen like 95% Sorry man Idk what to tell you 
Michael Lu: Lol ofc Iâm not gonna get into Stan 
Matthew Chen: Should still try but RDâs get much harder 
Michael Lu: So I should prob EA Stan 
Matthew Chen: You should EA Stan, ED2 Uchig 
Michael Lu: Do all colleges have EA 
Matthew Chen: No Some ED, some EA 
Michael Lu: Columbia EA? 
Matthew Chen: ED 
Michael Lu: Cornell? 
Matthew Chen: Scroll up 
Michael Lu: Just ed What abt Harvard 
Matthew Chen: EA However EA is restricted So you can only EA one school lol 
Michael Lu: Oh Fuq MIT? 
Matthew Chen: I really think you should go Columbia No No boy has gotten in For 11 years 
Michael Lu: MIT is only regular? 
Matthew Chen: Itâs ED? EA? EA I think 
Michael Lu: Dam 
Matthew Chen: Because Yuhan EA mit ED Columbia 
Michael Lu: Oh shittt 
Matthew Chen: Idk you gotta do research Some schools are not restrictive I forget 
Michael Lu: Ew do I have to research 
Matthew Chen: Obviously 
Michael Lu: Y 
Matthew Chen: Unless you get into your early Well unless you intend to transfer That school will be your next 4 
Michael Lu: Uhhh dam 
Matthew Chen: Tbh transferring is not a bad option 
Michael Lu: Lol so if I apply to 8 ivies + MIT & Stanford 
Matthew Chen: More people should consider it but itâs hella work RD Columbia Oof Nah fuck brown and Dartmouth Both are stupid Penn as well Those 3 are dumb, donât bother going 
Michael Lu: Which girl in my grade can get into Stan/MOT MIT 
Matthew Chen: Girls hard to say Your grade kinda sucks lol Which works out for you I may or may not have joked about the state of your A team for SciOly 
Michael Lu: LOL What happen 
Matthew Chen: But itâs pretty clear the quality is declining I think I told Ethan that half of A team was just warm bodies You can report me idgaf 
Michael Lu: Lol whatev 
Matthew Chen: Cornellâs not gonna rescind Your grade is top heavy so I think Columbia ED is a lock Stanford is always a super reach 
Michael Lu: What does that mean Columbia 
Matthew Chen: I think Columbia ED is within your reach If you apph Iâll give you a coin flip chance Stan is needle in haystack Kinda odds You could consider UC berk Good comp sci school 
Michael Lu: If I was a girl 
Matthew Chen: UC berk is a good school Dw dude Yuhan is not killing himself about ucla It is a good school Also, really the top 15 shuffle every couple of years Itâs really paying for brand name at that point If you donât get into Stan dw too much 
Michael Lu: Yo is Ethan Wang a better applicant 
Matthew Chen: Hmmm In terms of stem? Yes 
Michael Lu: Research? 
Matthew Chen: Which is why Iâm telllng you not to go generic You need to separate yourself Within stem 
Michael Lu: How far How much 
Matthew Chen: Enough for ppl to know you donât want to do research? Or that you have a set goal 
Michael Lu: Does research help? 
Matthew Chen: It doesnât have to be your life Research + girl = any school Sorry resrarch + girl + Asian 
Michael Lu: Lmao what abt research + boi 
Matthew Chen: =g = f Which is why Iâm saying to be a little less general to stand out Itâs gonna be hard to stand out anyway 
Michael Lu: Stand out in STEM? Like what if my focus was community service STEM 
Matthew Chen: Worked for Willy Zheng He did a lot of volunteering Teaching math to lil kids 
Michael Lu: Wiley Zheng Columbia Like why was the year before yours so successful? No offense You guys had a lot of powerhouse ppl 
Matthew Chen: Melody would be successsful any year Lol College admissions is rng A lot I heard Kimberley got a likely letter to yale or something And still reject 
Michael Lu: And then? Wtf Likely then rejected? 
Matthew Chen: Iâm pretty sure it may not be true But I know she didnât have much luck 
Michael Lu: Y 
Matthew Chen: With undergraduate admins Idk? Iâm not her dad You should def be paying me for this ð jk 
Michael Lu: Iâll pay u back if I get into a good school lol Which is very difficult 
Matthew Chen: Lol screenshotte Iâll take you up on your word Iâll probably not edit tho premed is hell Sorry 
Michael Lu: Premed lol have fun 
Matthew Chen: Maybe if we were closer friends but Iâm not a pro You need to seek professional help 
Michael Lu: Nah fuq that 
Matthew Chen: Also I think why Yuhan failed Was because he didnât get help 
Michael Lu: What did he do 
Matthew Chen: Most high school ppl write trash He did it all himself But when everyone is paying for editors Big hole to climb out of 
Michael Lu: Like no parents/proofreading No online guides 
Matthew Chen: Well idk about online gudies 
Michael Lu: Did u have a counselor? 
Matthew Chen: But he had no outside help 
Michael Lu: Oof 
Matthew Chen: You need help Or youâre def not getting into anything good 
Michael Lu: What kind of help 
Matthew Chen: Counseler or editor 
Michael Lu: Shiiiiiiiiiit 
Matthew Chen: My tutor helped me with mine, heâs insanely good With creative writing 
Michael Lu: Canât I just get an English teacher 
Matthew Chen: Not enough effort Or time You need someone full time Like my tutor literally stayed up with me editing at 1 
Michael Lu: How much did u pay him 
Matthew Chen: 500 
Michael Lu: Hah suc 
Matthew Chen: For full season For all my apps And unlimited edits and time An incredible steal Is more like it Some pay up to 10k 
Michael Lu: Wallet warriors 
Matthew Chen: Lol Iâm not that rich Sucks he moved on tho lol 
Michael Lu: Your grade is weird Bad RNG 
Matthew Chen: I still think UChicago Shoudl be a more premium destination Itâs literally gns 
Michael Lu: Dw Ethan, me, and Will Yan/Cai will get cucked together 
Matthew Chen: Just studying nerds I think Cai will get Stan Out of all of you 
Michael Lu: Lol y physics bowl? 
Matthew Chen: He has an incredible niche 
Michael Lu: Does he have strong grades/scores? 
Matthew Chen: But when I work with him he has this natural passion Yeah I mean all of you o Do Anderson is resume whore I think heâll go to Upenn lol 
Michael Lu: XD lol His math grades tho 
Matthew Chen: I donât foresee Anderson getting into a top tier Lol why Wb his math grades Itâs ok ethan has that 80 regents score 
Michael Lu: Yeah but âgrowth over timeâ 
Matthew Chen: Lol are Andersonâs math grades that bad 
Michael Lu: Sheidlower can get into Harvard for writing 
Matthew Chen: Nah 
Michael Lu: Geometry hit Anderson a bit hard 
Matthew Chen: Sheidlower is not getting into Harvard Northwestern maybe 
Michael Lu: Dafuq Isnât he smart 
Matthew Chen: Harvard is Harvard man 
Michael Lu: And like super passionate about journalism 
Matthew Chen: Incredible rng 
Michael Lu: What abt Lynne What warranted her admissions 
Matthew Chen: She studies âpsychâ I have no idea Tbh I thought Kimberley Had the best shot 
Michael Lu: Why 
Matthew Chen: But she ends up getting destroyed Sheâs literally perfect And stony med school isnât cheap 
Michael Lu: Dam was she only accepted by stony 
Matthew Chen: Itâs like 60k A year And her fam is def not getting di aid findaid Most ivies are fin aid stingy outside of Harvard thatâs because if you get into Harvard Youâre not rejecting because of aid resins Reasons Their endowment is more than small countries GDPs 
Michael Lu: Does aid lower your chances of getting in 
Matthew Chen: Yes But idk how much At the end of the day Itâs a business If you can pay great! 
Michael Lu: That wants to be rich and diverse like google 
Matthew Chen: If not, whoops No surprise many ppl Are rich, white and usually both In all the elite unis Also, please donât apply to yale if youâre doing stem 
Michael Lu: Y 
Matthew Chen: Youâre wasting your money Yale is if you want to be president or something Youâre literally just going down the top 15 list lol You should do some research 
Michael Lu: No my dad is 
Matthew Chen: Rip 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Matthew Chen: Iâm gonna tell you now Youâre probably not getting into mit Or Stan Or Harvard Idk man just work hard 
Michael Lu: And apply to U chig haha 
Matthew Chen: Lol Uchig is ehh Itâs really liberal arts research based 
Michael Lu: K then 
Matthew Chen: The atmosphere there is really glum The neighborhood is bad Like someone sucked the life out of there If you want to study all day Thatâs your school If you want a more diverse top school Iâd suggest Stan Columbia Cornell Also Uchig has no grade inflation Youâre gonna get Bâs potentially 
Michael Lu: Whatevs 
Matthew Chen: If you can live with all that then yeah go for it 
Michael Lu: Dam is anyone in our grade Gonna be successful with college 
Matthew Chen: Idk You all seem too concerned with grades and clout Iâd say 75% of you burn out 
Michael Lu: Lol whatev

Matthew Chen: Nah just semifinalist Regional is one step higher 
Michael Lu: What U got semifinals? 
Matthew Chen: Idk itâs a weird system Pretty sure itâs a national comp I donât think you need to worry about Siemens seeing as itâs been dead 
Michael Lu: Iâm just wondering 
Matthew Chen: Ic 
Michael Lu: Abt Shawn Kangâs high yield rate last year Explain 
Matthew Chen: About what 
Michael Lu: What did Shawn do that Adrian and Yuhan didnât 
Matthew Chen: I feel like this would be a more appropriate question to ask Shawn I literally have no idea 
Michael Lu: Sure sure 
Matthew Chen: I donât talk to Shawn much His essays were probably good 
Michael Lu: Ok mr national semifinalist 
Matthew Chen: Dude idk anymore 
Michael Lu: Also did every Asian who got into their school last year have a counselor? 
Matthew Chen: Pretty much 
Michael Lu: Wow fuck 
Matthew Chen: It was harder to find someone who didnât Yuhan didnât have one Which may or may not have affected his chances That was probably not a wise move but Yuhan is Yuhan Dude if u donât get in just transfer Thereâs literally no point of being salty if u donât get in 
Michael Lu: K 
Matthew Chen: If youâve followed the Harvard thing itâs pretty rigged K

Michael Lu: Sir How would an Asian parent consider Berkeley in terms of prestige? 
Matthew Chen: Are you considering berk? 
Michael Lu: Didnât even apply 
Matthew Chen: Then why do u ask lol 
Michael Lu: To any UCs For my Asian friends with tiger parents 
Matthew Chen: I thought as much Hmmm.... they plan to study CS? 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Matthew Chen: Or engineering? Wonderful 
Michael Lu: Idk whatâs the diff 
Matthew Chen: Itâs top in CS And EE The drawback is itâs a big school so classes might fill fast + grade defaltion Tell ur friends fit matters more 
Michael Lu: You think anybody in our shitty school Gives a fuck Abt fit? 
Matthew Chen: You asked for my opinion 
Michael Lu: And I got it 
Matthew Chen: Iâm saying itâs fine Itâs a good school Might b hard to standout 
Michael Lu: Is this the consensus among cancerous tiger parents tho 
Matthew Chen: Older ppl might like it in china/taiwan berk is better known than other top tier colleges But tbh cancerous tiger parents like name brands So it may not matter anyway 
Michael Lu: Berkeley vs HYPSM? 
Matthew Chen: Yeah + Columbia, if you believe in us news 
Michael Lu: Berkeley > HYPSM in terms of clout? 
Matthew Chen: I think Berkeley kids might have lower self esteem than even Cornell 
Michael Lu: Why Oh lol 
Matthew Chen: Also ofc berkeely will lose to hypsm in terms of clout, but their CS is on par Everything else I heard is pretty sub par 
Michael Lu: Interesting 
Matthew Chen: It seems a lot of people got into Berkeley this year 
Michael Lu: Yep Not Cornell tho Or any other Ivy League rd for that matter 
Matthew Chen: Interesting I mean, a lot of people EDâd 
Michael Lu: Yeah I guess You are right Sometimes 
Matthew Chen: I know I was gonna ask u lol 
Michael Lu: I guess once the ivies closed their doors The other schools opened theirs up. 
Matthew Chen: Stanford chose some interesting ppl this year 
Michael Lu: Yes yes And only one of them dis earth science I was confident that ethan would be the only one to get in Lol 
Matthew Chen: I disagreed lol 
Michael Lu: TBH 
Matthew Chen: I was wrong about mit 
Michael Lu: Iâm talking abt Stanford bud 
Matthew Chen: I know Just saying I was wrong about mit 
Michael Lu: Oh lol 
Matthew Chen: Nah Stanford likes ppl with vitality Like a natural passion or affinity for something 
Michael Lu: Thatâs every school kinda 
Matthew Chen: I guess 
Michael Lu: Stanford is just vocal abt it 
Matthew Chen: Stanford likes their cult re Did u stress culture and fit Lol 
Michael Lu: I was a retarded writer before December So no 
Matthew Chen: F 
Michael Lu: I mean Iâm fine wasting an app on Stanford It helped me get into other schools So will cai got into no ivies But got into Stanford 
Matthew Chen: Basically Which id argue is better Cmon itâs stanford 
Michael Lu: Oh def Stanford is the best in the world 
Matthew Chen: I canât believe he was talking about between Berkeley and Stan An hour ago 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Matthew Chen: Enough with that shit With that being said do u plan to commit to mit 
Michael Lu: Prob No better options besides a Harvard waitlist And some other lower ivies 
Matthew Chen: Interesting

Michael Lu: Would this be a GroupMe or messenger chat? 
Matthew Cox: I donât know. Iâm pretty sure itâs not possible to start a messenger groupchat with fewer than 3 people, so if we go with messenger weâll have to wait for a third person. 
Michael Lu: How many ppl are in DME? total

Michael Lu: Whenever he quotes hill billies or racists 
Nick Langel: like is the word nigger a regional word?? 
Michael Lu: I put down 81 
Nick Langel: cuz i was gonna do 81 yea 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Nick Langel: but i wasn't sure if it was actually an example do u think Auld's conversation with sophia about reading is a valid one? "If you give a nigger an inch, he will take an ell. A nigger should know nothing but to obey his master â to do as he is told to do. Learning would spoil the best nigger in the world." 
Michael Lu: If you can find enough instances of distinct lingo from Baltimore in that itâll probably work 
Nick Langel: wait i realized we aren't talking about the same example on 81 there isn't even dialogue on 81 
Michael Lu: Oh whatâs 81 for u 
Nick Langel: his fight with covey 
Michael Lu: What part 
Nick Langel: the very beginning of it from his last bit about the root to "but just as he was leaning over to get the.." 
Michael Lu: Oh lol 
Nick Langel: where did you quote from? 
Michael Lu: The part where all the Baltimore ship dudes were calling him in 20 diff places 
Nick Langel: Damn yea that's not my page 81 lol 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Wait for the part II do you just record the page number and example No explaining?

Nick Langel: somewhat limiting 
Michael Lu: U thot But it yaint But it kinda is 
Nick Langel: what tone word from the sheet would you use to describe his little monologue contrasting the ships with hsi bondage; the one with all the "O"s 
Michael Lu: Sad Idk the tone sheet kinda limited I donât rlly HAVE to use em He hinted at using the sheet Also, unless he asks you to print out your guide, he wonât check/grade it 
Nick Langel: Wtf? Wait also it says to pick tone words from the sheet 
Michael Lu: Doesnât it say Hint 
Nick Langel: Nope Although 
Michael Lu: Lol I guess itâs implied to pick 3 words From the sheet 
Nick Langel: yeah it says review it and pick 
Michael Lu: Welp :/ 
Nick Langel: yeah im just gonna take words that aren't on the sheet too 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Nick Langel: i dont think he really cares as long as they make sense

Conversation:
Nick Langel: For question 15 of part 3, is he asking for the significance of douglass' new name in the context of the lady of the lake Or just as a new name for a new man kinda thing 
Michael Lu: Yeah new name new man Idk wtf lady and lake 
Nick Langel: Like the poem that his name came from 
Michael Lu: Yeah but this whimsical choice shouldnât really have any thoughtful symbolism Maybe there is by counted Coincidence Idk 
Nick Langel: Idk maybe if the story itself had some symbolism pertaining to douglass Ight 
Michael Lu: Lol

Michael Lu: Lmao dis goon 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: yo do you get the wack ass theme for NCTE 
Nick Langel: not reallllly the example is kinda shady tbh 
Michael Lu: like they use story and narrative so interchangeably without defining either really well. 
Nick Langel: i think they expect creative responses to such a vague prompt 
Michael Lu: oh maybe 
Nick Langel: you can kind of get their general idea of a change in perspective or at least thats what the example kind of alludes to 
Michael Lu: I guess, but if you "change your story" that's basically like making a radical life change and they interchange narrative and story 
Nick Langel: i'm also bullshitting rn cuz i haven't even done mine 
Michael Lu: lol I'm asking Ethan and Noah too rn 
Nick Langel: yeah idk i know annie zhang said that you shouldn't follow the prompt verbatim 
Michael Lu: yeah 
Nick Langel: uniqueness over preciseness 
Michael Lu: foqin english ppl making life hard and subjective 
Nick Langel: it's why english teachers are all dead inside they know their jobs are inherently subjective 
Michael Lu: xd u savage foq me daddy 
Nick Langel: scholars <3 we're all giving the same pseudo-intellectual response lmao 
Michael Lu: XD pseudo-intellect response, aka the response of english ppl 
Nick Langel: nice and subjective 
Michael Lu: NCTE = Naturally Confusing Themes from Economically-unstable-adults-trying-to-survive-with-their-life-mistakes-of-trying-to-become-the-next-charles-dickens 
Nick Langel: Wow Who's the savage now

Nick Langel: I just wanted to know if I had to switch EDs Respectfully 
Michael Lu: Go wherever u want 
Nick Langel: Ah but itâs not that simple The system Thatâs what the system wants you to do 
Michael Lu: Donât worry about ppl in this school bc 
A) ur prob more qualified than other applicants
B. Unless itâs Cornell or shit, youâre not competing for so many spots If 10 kids apply to Princeton yeah thatâs a prob But like at most itâs 4 or 5 for high tier schools And ur not even going in for the same majors probably 
Nick Langel: They donât even look at major seriously 
Michael Lu: They do thatâs why CS applicants get cucked 
Nick Langel: They want that spherical liberal arts applicant Well 
Michael Lu: âThatâs what the system wants you to [think]â Look if u were fucking Research kid number #10384638 Does science Olympiad and joss HOSA maybe u can play ur college distribution game But u shouldnât rlly worry Because ur separate from the GN cancer So if u want Princeton Go Princeton

Nick Langel: Yeah I have 
Michael Lu: If any school were to reject you I doubt its because they canât take 2 or 3 kids from the same school Itâs not political Itâs not a state geographical issue A good application Fucks the system in the pussy So dw about the political game and donât try to control it Just hope the ducking lawsuit works in our favor XD

Itâs a short 5-10 min thing and your fave memory of him will be edited into the thank you video. LMK if you wanna be apart of this project and again please donât let this spread to Ko as I want it to be a surprise.

Michael Lu: We are considering a robot that does solely exchange runs for the vault and climbing. 
Noah Kniesly: Why? 
Michael Lu: Guarantees more points. 45 + 30 + 30 + Boost/Force 
Noah Kniesly: Exchange and climb give 105 points. One box in switch in auto gives up to 120 points 
Michael Lu: Exactly 
Noah Kniesly: What are you agreeing to 
Michael Lu: Vault strategy guarantees points. 
Noah Kniesly: That strategy gives pat med the scale and gives them a free 110 points 
Michael Lu: Assuming the opponent does the scale and our team canât. 
Noah Kniesly: That is not a certainty at sbpli 
Michael Lu: Ok

Michael Lu: Full team 
Noah Kniesly: for how long? 
Michael Lu: Every year, as long as itâs renewed by mentors. 
Noah Kniesly: from solid works? 
Michael Lu: Do you know how similar the two are in usage? Yes, every year SolidWorks is partnered with First 
Noah Kniesly: from my understanding, they are nearly identical 
Michael Lu: Okay 
Noah Kniesly: of course gui is different 
Michael Lu: How different? 
Noah Kniesly: small features may be different no box scroll box 
Michael Lu: Have you used SW? 
Noah Kniesly: no you would have to teach a whole new program 
Michael Lu: Iâll look into it more after APs Teach whom? Besides myself? 
Noah Kniesly: cole reid etc 
Michael Lu: Freshman can learn on their own. 
Noah Kniesly: you can't cad a whole robot by yourself you are expecting too much 
Michael Lu: And itâs not like they have enough CAD experience yet 
Noah Kniesly: okay. Me and fion won't be able to help as much next year.

Michael Lu: CAD next year 
Noah Kniesly: such as? 
Michael Lu: Solidworks Summer assignments 
Noah Kniesly: solid works doesn't work on macs 
Michael Lu: Neither does inventor I donât believe 
Noah Kniesly: true but summer assignments can only be completed by some. Unless you want group work 
Michael Lu: What does that mean About operating system compatibility? 
Noah Kniesly: ex. cole couldn't do it on his MacBook air i guess if people have pros, they could run virtual desktop 
Michael Lu: Yeah thatâs what Reid does Do you guys not have any desktops? 
Noah Kniesly: i have my lenovo workstation. But I am talking more about others, unless cad next year is only you three

Noah Kniesly: Making this is required to access the machine shop at Michigan 
Michael Lu: Wow thatâs impressive Handmade? 
Noah Kniesly: Yep No Using shears, punches, horizontal bandsaw, drill press, Bender, tap and die, files 
Michael Lu: Interesting What would you use it for 
Noah Kniesly: Pencil holder Useless as such, but it ensures people know how to use basic tools 
Michael Lu: You can derive some utility from it I guess 
Noah Kniesly: Requiring it at south would lessen the amount of lost drill bits Do a similar thing for cad 
Michael Lu: Yup 


Conversation:
Noah Kniesly: How is the college search going? Also, according to my brother you hate me?

Noah Kniesly: Are you doing cad? 
Michael Lu: Good question I will be 


Conversation:
Noah Kniesly: Opinion on this years robot? Was cad used extensively this year 
Michael Lu: Prettyfoosu Good CAD was used extensively EXCEPT on motchs lifting mechanism (exactly like last year But it was quickly CADded And saved So the robot looks pretty nice 
Noah Kniesly: Why are electronics in the outside? 
Michael Lu: Accessibility I think They will be covered tho 
Noah Kniesly: Surprising how the one part that wasnât cadded failed 
Michael Lu: Lol

Michael Lu: Idk 


Conversation:
Noah Kniesly: Doing solidworks for engineering now. Nicer in some ways, but some of the ux is terrible. Inventors right click and the box, and the ability to easily toggle between parts are sorely missed 


Conversation:
Noah Kniesly: Decided on what you are studying ? 
Michael Lu: No 
Noah Kniesly: ideas though? 
Michael Lu: MechE/CS 
Noah Kniesly: mechE???? CS and mechE aren't the two people choose between. Usually its EE/CS or like ME/CE 
Michael Lu: Ont Interesting

Michael Lu: Hi Noah 
Noah Sheidlower: Hi 
Michael Lu: You know that one centroid proof where we had to prove the 2/3 1/3 ratio 
Noah Sheidlower: Yes 
Michael Lu: that took us 2 classes Is that on the test? 
Noah Sheidlower: Points of Concurrency: Incenter and Circumcenter, Equivalence Postulates and basic proofs, Vertical angles and Parallel lines/Tranversals theorems and algebraic problems 
Michael Lu: I know 
Noah Sheidlower: This counts as an equivalence postulate 
Michael Lu: really? wut? 
Noah Sheidlower: I think so 
Michael Lu: how 2/3 1/3 ratio of centriods? 
Noah Sheidlower: I don't know, study everything 
Michael Lu: alright but it's not an easy proof and it takes a long time 
Noah Sheidlower: I know It will probs not be on the test, but study it anyway 
Michael Lu: okeye potato 
Noah Sheidlower: U ready for the essay ?

Conversation:
Michael Lu: The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell. 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Noah How much detail can we put on the essay outline? 
Noah Sheidlower: Same as last time. Topic sentence, thesis, quotes written out, target points listed... What's ur thesis? Mine is companionship not only leads people to fulfill their dreams but also leads dreams and hope to failure. (Not exact, but somewhat correct) 
Michael Lu: I simplified it to companionship increases the confidence in dreams You can definitely support your thesis, very good thesis 
Noah Sheidlower: I wanted to see what others are doing There isn't much you could do 
Michael Lu: I did a lot kinda But it required a lot of close reading Like, a few hours well, nevermind you're right There wasn't too much So you had to close read a lot and make up good BS 


Conversation:
Noah Sheidlower: Mde. Schwartz didn't post an assignment. Are you having trouble accessing it? 


Conversation:
Noah Sheidlower: So the French test is JUST food names, ordering phrases, the French dining table, andculture/store types, right?

Conversation:
Noah Sheidlower: Is the French assignment due on December 8th or is the suggestion for the assignment due December 8th? "Proposer" means both to suggest and to complete, so idk 
Michael Lu: december 8th is when you need to make up your mind on what you are doing 
Noah Sheidlower: Ok. Thanks. What are u doing? I'm interested in the Chateau de Versailles/Jardin de Versailles 


Conversation:

Conversation:
Noah Sheidlower: Did u do your topic proposal yet? 
Michael Lu: no i might do it today i need to check the criteria 
Noah Sheidlower: I did it today but there is no submission assignment... I was wondering if anybody started it 
Michael Lu: yah i know was it easy? just mechanically answering each bullet point? 
Noah Sheidlower: Really easy. Journalism topic proposals are a little more difficult. These are straightforward. 
Michael Lu: ok what's your topic? 
Noah Sheidlower: Trumpet vs. Flugelhorn 
Michael Lu: :D how long did the proposal take you? 
Noah Sheidlower: 15 minutes 
Michael Lu: oke does the proposal have to be very long? mine is like, a few sentences and barely is half the page 
Noah Sheidlower: It only needs to address the requirements. She wants to know the outline of what you are writing. Once she approves it, then you write the full thing. 
Michael Lu: ok thx

Michael Lu: ok then tomorrow yes 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: no noo rlly? 
Noah Sheidlower: Do you know how to prove the transformations Mr. Dickson told us to prove for extra credit? I wont say anything in class bc I didn't come up with it myself, but I'm interested if u know the answer. Thanks 
Michael Lu: no i didn't try 


Conversation:
Noah Sheidlower: How do you solve #11 on the math hw? Thanks . Never mind 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: did you find the soc hw 
Noah Sheidlower: No. Different textbook 
Michael Lu: ok, thought so thx was there math hw 
Noah Sheidlower: I do not think so because Dickson never went over the rectangle proofs yet and none of us brought home our Springboard books. 
Michael Lu: ok thx again! 
Noah Sheidlower: Did you check turnitin? 
Michael Lu: ya 


Conversation:
Noah Sheidlower: Did you figure out the proof? I'm stuck after a few steps never mind i got it Wait my method doesn't work... Did you prove the two bottom triangles congruent? 
Michael Lu: no did it in 4 steps if it's legit hopefully it is 
Noah Sheidlower: Did you draw the diagonals? 
Michael Lu: no drawin 
Noah Sheidlower: ? 
Michael Lu: 1 step for given 1 step for proof statement pretty much 2 steps of proving 
Noah Sheidlower: I'm trying to prove it by proving the two bottom triangles congruent, but you arent given enough info to say that it is equilateral Or even isoceles 
Michael Lu: i know, lemme pull up the proof and see you don't need diagnoals just prove that the two bottom triangles are congruent 
Noah Sheidlower: I did 
Michael Lu: ok BE = BF 
Noah Sheidlower: And ED = FD 
Michael Lu: yea 
Noah Sheidlower: But I don't know how to get BE = ED 
Michael Lu: lemme think 
Noah Sheidlower: You would need angle EDA congruent to EAD and same for other triangle 
Michael Lu: lol, my 4 step proof don't work lemme work on it 
Noah Sheidlower: ok 
Michael Lu: ok i have an idea 
Noah Sheidlower: ok 
Michael Lu: gotty 
Noah Sheidlower: How many steps 
Michael Lu: 11 
Noah Sheidlower: Did you prove the two bottom triangles congruent? 
Michael Lu: yea my first proof was completely wrong lel 
Noah Sheidlower: It took me 7 steps to prove the two triangles congruent 
Michael Lu: it took me 6, but only because of isocelse vs angles opposite so yeah, ur on right track 
Noah Sheidlower: You proved the rhombus by saying that all four sides were congruent right? 
Michael Lu: no 
Noah Sheidlower: Oh 
Michael Lu: that's what makes it hard 
Noah Sheidlower: Does it have to do with the adjacent sides being congruent? 
Michael Lu: yeap at first i just proved BE congruent to BF and said its a rhombus because adjacent sides congruent but that's wrong lel congruent adjacent sides will be part of the proof 
Noah Sheidlower: This is hard... 
Michael Lu: it is 
Noah Sheidlower: So basically you just have to prove BE = to ED and BF = to FD? There seems to be other elements to it 
Michael Lu: no 
Noah Sheidlower: no angles? 
Michael Lu: err you don't need to prove BE = Ed or BF = FD 
Noah Sheidlower: Ugh 
Michael Lu: use other pairs of adjacent sides 
Noah Sheidlower: Once I prove ED = EA, its so easy... But Im trying to figure out how to prove it 
Michael Lu: okay i went a different way are you trying to prove EA = EB in the long run? 
Noah Sheidlower: That's already proved (midpoint E) 
Michael Lu: i mean ED = EB 
Noah Sheidlower: I think so, but I think that it may be something different 
Michael Lu: okeee 
Noah Sheidlower: Ugh Is it possible to prove AE = AD? 
Michael Lu: idk, never tried it 
Noah Sheidlower: AD = DE also doesn't seem like it works I'll come back to the proof later 
Michael Lu: ok 
Noah Sheidlower: Ya 


Conversation:
Noah Sheidlower: Is there math textbook hw 
Michael Lu: don't think so 
Noah Sheidlower: Thanks 


Conversation:
Noah Sheidlower: Oops, forgot to write short answers in pen. And it seems weird that we don't have a French test tomorrow... 


Conversation:
Noah Sheidlower: What did you do in math? 
Michael Lu: learned how to prove median of a triangle is parallel and average lengths of bases we didn't write out the proof yet though we only analyzed it 
Noah Sheidlower: "Analyzed" 
Michael Lu: err, lemme send you to write out the proof was the hw sent it 
Noah Sheidlower: Thanks 
Michael Lu: school docs 


Conversation:
Noah Sheidlower: I didn't receive the notes. Sorry 
Michael Lu: what is your school email 
Noah Sheidlower: nsheidlower1... 
Michael Lu: resent 
Noah Sheidlower: Thx pt 1 on midterm is only multiple choice right 
Michael Lu: lol mr dickson has a fb 
Noah Sheidlower: Yass 
Michael Lu: ima give it to ethan wang 
Noah Sheidlower: Hehe Look at him with all the dish fishes I found Ms. Aguado's baby 
Michael Lu: ? ima look up all my teachers 
Noah Sheidlower: Jennifer L Hastings No luck 
Michael Lu: don't mention my name tuesday tell mr dickson nothing 
Noah Sheidlower: K Will category 4 be on the midterm? We never covered area in class And are you studying your notes as well? 


Conversation:
Noah Sheidlower: For the math hw, how do you prove that the diagonals of the trapezoid are congruent if you cant use base angles are congruent? I don't think you could. You have to prove the other theorem first 
Michael Lu: prove base engels first 
Noah Sheidlower: Yeah i did that... 
Michael Lu: how long is listen for line supposed to be 
Noah Sheidlower: A well-developed paragraph; I would say 3/4 of a double-spaced page if you could come up with that much to write. Otherwise 10 sentences sounds like a sufficient amount. I didn't do the assignment yet so I may not be the best person to ask. 
Michael Lu: k 


Conversation:
Noah Sheidlower: Do you like Millevoi? 


Conversation:
Noah Sheidlower: Lol

Conversation:
Noah Sheidlower: What did u get for the area of the leftover paper in q2 
Michael Lu: 102/6.5 i believe simplifying to 15.blah blah blah 
Noah Sheidlower: perfect what i got 
Michael Lu: yeeee 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Where is the French HW 
Noah Sheidlower: The bonus? 
Michael Lu: didn't she say she was gong to post an assigment today? not the writing 
Noah Sheidlower: Idk 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: how much detail are you supposed to put on the soc project cartoon description aspect? 
Noah Sheidlower: Definition should be a bit specific but not more than two sentences.

Depending on your image, more interpretation may need to be explained (ie. some of my cards are 3-5 sentences). 

The effect on society should be considerably longer than your definition, most likely a short paragraph where you discuss all aspects of the word or phrase. For example, if doing anthropology, explain its general effect on many periods of history. If doing something like Meiji Restoration, of course only mention its impact to the time period and its effect on Japan and possibly neighboring countries. Don't go crazy because there are only so many lines (and spaces between the paragraphs). 
Michael Lu: what's the effect on society thing? 
Noah Sheidlower: Last bullet... Aka how does this term fall into place in history The sheet outlines it 
Michael Lu: i don't think you have to go that into depth do you? in the example the kid was a scrub 
Noah Sheidlower: Probs not 
Michael Lu: and had a one sentence definition 
Noah Sheidlower: You don't need more than one 
Michael Lu: m8, you have 32 terms is the definition different from effect? because i put effect/significance with definition 
Noah Sheidlower: She quotes "it looks easy, but it's a lot of work." And yeah that works 
Michael Lu: okee 
Noah Sheidlower: Ask her though bc she's picky 
Michael Lu: i'll ask tomorrow 
Noah Sheidlower: Did u finish the txtbk hw 
Michael Lu: yea 
Noah Sheidlower: How long did it take you 
Michael Lu: idk not that lo0ng because all vocab was in the textbook 
Noah Sheidlower: I'm 45 minutes in and still working... I think I try too hard... She doesn't really check 
Michael Lu: you probably try too hard 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: How specific should these "supporting details" be for the index card project significance in history aspect? If only I could read the example she gave i can pick out some words in the example, and the kid looked like he didn't give too many examples, but I suppose he still got a 4 because logi logic* logos logs 
Noah Sheidlower: What did she say? 
Michael Lu: hehe about what 
Noah Sheidlower: Your card 
Michael Lu: i needed to rearrange the orginization of part B C and D, they weren't separated enough 
Noah Sheidlower: What do u mean? 
Michael Lu: but she didn't talk about the quality of the work provided i combined definition with significance 
Noah Sheidlower: Don't stress it... 
Michael Lu: okeee so i don't need to give specific examples, like ww1 ww2 britain in south africa etc 
Noah Sheidlower: You should have one or two to strengthen the response  
Michael Lu: ok i'll look into it tomorrow well for some terms they are already specific so lol like boxer revolution 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: didn't we have to identify the speaker on the figurative language ID's on the Caesar test? 
Noah Sheidlower: Yeah study who says what 
Michael Lu: aw crap 
Noah Sheidlower: It's only the notable ones 
Michael Lu: okee yolo 
Noah Sheidlower: â 
Michael Lu: do you think she'll put the unicorn quote on the test 
Noah Sheidlower: As a troll yeah 
Michael Lu: caesar loves unicorns 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: which notes do ya need? 
Noah Sheidlower: Any English soc or math that you can 
Michael Lu: ok 
Noah Sheidlower: Thanks 
Michael Lu: soc is on google class math i shared a picture on docs english there is one sheet online and i'll scan her example essay if she didn't give it to you 
Noah Sheidlower: Thanks 
Michael Lu: did she give you all the sheets? Ms hastings? 
Noah Sheidlower: Yeah 
Michael Lu: oh ok you got the example essay and outline? 
Noah Sheidlower:  Yes thx 
Michael Lu: okee then math is only thing that's new 


Conversation:
Noah Sheidlower: Did Hastings make any comments about the essay that I should know about? And was Millevoi not in school? And did u get any tests back? ? 
Michael Lu: no tests back millevoi was absent Ms. Hastings didn't say anything new 
Noah Sheidlower: So u did stuff in millevois class? 
Michael Lu: do you think? 
Noah Sheidlower: I guess u picked an article and wrote about it 
Michael Lu: not everyone did that but yeah 
Noah Sheidlower: Lol Did you study for english 
Michael Lu: ye 
Noah Sheidlower: Did u do much for it? 
Michael Lu: ye 
Noah Sheidlower: I just did the sheet and I'm doing a practice essay 
Michael Lu: same 
Noah Sheidlower: There isn't too much to analyze 
Michael Lu: it's really pointing out the structure Ms. Hastings practically analyzed the entire thing in class she just wants to test how well you can explain your content 
Noah Sheidlower: So what methods did she want you to use? 
Michael Lu: methods? 
Noah Sheidlower: Like how did she say to explain it? 
Michael Lu: she didn't say that 
Noah Sheidlower: So Just like any other essay? 
Michael Lu: i guess it is certainly an essay that is different 
Noah Sheidlower: Well its not an analysis essay so to speak 
Michael Lu: in a way yep it's a rhetorical analysis not literary 
Noah Sheidlower: It should not be too difficult Especially when she gave you all of the answers 
Michael Lu: yep the most recent essay was probably the hardest essay because we had to analyze and write 
Noah Sheidlower: If you explain it well, then all you have to worry about is grammar and development of the essay 
Michael Lu: yep 
Noah Sheidlower: Her example didn't seem too difficult to replicate 
Michael Lu: yep it didn't seem as good as her other works, i feel partly because of the topic though 
Noah Sheidlower: Yeah. It was simple 


Conversation:
Noah Sheidlower: ... 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Are there any specific subheadings we are supposed to make or are we allowed to choose what info we can put (Soc Invention Project) And what's a supporting detail? Are we supposed to cite some statistic 
Noah Sheidlower: Definitely something along the lines of efficiency or durability. Statistics may be hard to find but show how it has impacted ____ with regards to ______ So like fireworks:
Has impacted China's religious ceremonies. 
1. New holiday
2. Improved family connections
3. New way of respecting/honoring ancestors
...and then build upon each one. Statistics are irrelevant bc who cares how many people performed ____  
Michael Lu: oh i see, thx do we have to cite somebody in a "specific detail" 
Noah Sheidlower: Like who Lol Sure Abe was 
Michael Lu: wait wada hell im mentioned i gotta check this 
Noah Sheidlower: This story is...

Michael Lu: me too partly because i watched a BBC adaptation but yeah 
Noah Sheidlower: lol 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: I'm back and i have questions what did you do in english class what did you do in math class how was the soc and french quiz? did she go over how to do the proposal? 
Noah Sheidlower: English we discussed types of sources. She briefly mentioned the other assignments
Math we did special angle cofunctions.
Soc was stupid
French was difficult (only the listening was) since the audio was poor and they talked rather fast 
Michael Lu: thx m8! 
Noah Sheidlower: What's ur costume  
Michael Lu: an toga4 is brown 
Noah Sheidlower: ok I'm still figuring mine out Togas are cool but I need to show some kind of restriction, "and will not palter" 
Michael Lu: what are you performing 
Noah Sheidlower: Brutus monologue, "no, not an oath" 
Michael Lu: okeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee can you send me the entire sheet on google drive? for math, thank you! 
Noah Sheidlower: Wait K 
Michael Lu: thx he showed graphed trig functions right? did you go over law of sin or cos? 
Noah Sheidlower: He showed us graphs and we went over special angles. Wait what's the law 
Michael Lu: okay you didn't go over it mr. dickson said we'll get to it oneday and it was on his website but i assume it's not on the test 
Noah Sheidlower: What is it 
Michael Lu: calculating sides of scalene triangles based on two sides and one angle 
Noah Sheidlower: No 
Michael Lu: no idea what law of sines is 
Noah Sheidlower: Do u have a research topic yet 
Michael Lu: nop 
Noah Sheidlower: Me neither, still finishing performance 
Michael Lu: yep 
Noah Sheidlower: Not fully memorized so... 
Michael Lu: ho  ho ho well nick memorized something 22 lines lol 
Noah Sheidlower: Shouldn't he just do someone else's lines Like servant? 
Michael Lu: lol btw, doesn't cot(tan(90)) = 0? tan 90 = 1/0 take the recipricol of that? 
Noah Sheidlower: I guess 
Michael Lu: idk hold on idk because tan90 = infinity/undefined 
Noah Sheidlower: ... 
Michael Lu: is't possible!? - Cassius i don't get the csc of sin stuff 
Noah Sheidlower: We didn't go in depth with secants and cosecants 
Michael Lu: what does csc(sin0) stuff mean did he go over that? some of it doesn't make sense 
Noah Sheidlower: Well undefined x 0? 
Michael Lu: idk is it on the test? 
Noah Sheidlower: There's no test on Tuesday it's next week I think 
Michael Lu: OH Oh crap wow thx for telling me i thought it was this tuesday lol 
Noah Sheidlower: His website says the 5th right Of april 
Michael Lu: yea oops i'll ask him on tuesday then thx 
Noah Sheidlower: Sure np 
Michael Lu: time to study le francais then and then soc then i gotta finish the performance and research stuff btw did you go to the meet 
Noah Sheidlower: Yeah  
Michael Lu: was there math HW?

Noah Sheidlower: . How do you arc degree on a calculator? I can't get it to work anymore Find I mean arc length Didn't you have to make a point or something like that 
Michael Lu: for major arcs, you need a point in between two endpoints 
Noah Sheidlower: How for minor arcs?  
Michael Lu: no thrid point needed 
Noah Sheidlower: What are the commands, the measurement is off 
Michael Lu: measure arc length, and circumference length 
Noah Sheidlower: I'm confused about how to measure arc length because my calculator only measures the distance between the two points 
Michael Lu: don't use the length command select the arc and measure that not the points 
Noah Sheidlower: So how do you do the arc length without selecting the points 
Michael Lu: length command 
Noah Sheidlower: I can't select the arc only. It only gives me the measurement of the circumference 
Michael Lu: tab press tab 
Noah Sheidlower: Still can't get it. Idk why Press tab on the circle or the points 
Michael Lu: circle 
Noah Sheidlower: So I have this circle and tab doesn't work for me. Sorry but I suck with this calculator Tab exits out of the measurement command It only gives me the circumference measure 
Michael Lu: hover over the arc does the mouse say circle or arc/ ? 
Noah Sheidlower: Circle There's no arc option 
Michael Lu: did you create an arc? or did you only place points on the circle? make sure you created circle arc with 4. Points and Lines then 9. Circle arc 
Noah Sheidlower: Thanks so much. I'm so bad with the calculator

Conversation:
Michael Lu: can you explain the NCTE theme because the description doesn't distinguish between story and narrative. 
Noah Sheidlower: How does one change the narrative of their life, society, etc. 
Michael Lu: now that's the thing 
Noah Sheidlower: Like what actions can you take I guess Or how has something changed 
Michael Lu: When you change a story it implies changing something about your life 
Noah Sheidlower: Doesn't Have to 
Michael Lu: Whereas changing your narrative, according to the use of "spinning your narrative" is about changing perception of events. 
Noah Sheidlower: There isn't really a difference between the 2 
Michael Lu: like if I were to say I changed my story that can be interpreted as like, idk I stopped being lazy or smthing 
Noah Sheidlower: You can say either I believe interchangeably 
Michael Lu: Okay, so like the theme asks for a change in how something is perceived? 
Noah Sheidlower: Doesn't have to be in how something is perceived. It can be a literal change also. 
Michael Lu: wot da foq so to change a narrative is to change one's life itself literally? 
Noah Sheidlower: Its about looking at a situation, changing your perception, then potentially acting to change it. So you need to change your perception on something You dont physically have to change anything But its more a side effect I guess But again a lot is up for interpretation 
Michael Lu: So changing a narrative is more of changing perception 
Noah Sheidlower: So it can be literal if you want 
Michael Lu: dammmmm 
Noah Sheidlower: That's why its a weird prompt 
Michael Lu: is this confusing? or intentionally subjective? 
Noah Sheidlower: Its supposed to be vague So that you can interpret what narrative means But I interpret a narrative is just the way life is headed if you follow your daily routine And that changing it is looking at it from a diff lens and then acting to change it 
Michael Lu: alright, so i won't necessarily go wrong if I write about literally changing my life? there's probably enough overlap? 
Noah Sheidlower: I wouldn't worry about it Just make it clear 
Michael Lu: make it clear there's some change? 
Noah Sheidlower: Yeah 
Michael Lu: aight thx m8 !!! :)

Noah Sheidlower: I guess you can concede that it may be too expensive to do so and then make a compromise bw them 
Michael Lu: But then u concede at the end of the argument and that, according to Graham, weakens paper

Conversation:
Michael Lu: Who writes for the Great Neck Record? Are writers usually fully employed and dedicated writers? Or are they occasional writers who submit a story when they want to? 
Noah Sheidlower: The only occasional writers are high school writers who rarely submit anything but have some journalism experience. Afaik most writers with solid journalism experience (including me) are writing one or two articles a week, but only a few writers are paid staff (not me) 
Michael Lu: If these writers submit an article, it doesnât guarantee entry into the paper right? The chief editor has to approve?

Noah Sheidlower: Sorry to keep bugging you but like was the first one hard in that there were so many questions or hard in that the questions themselves are hard

Patrick Duan: Same I did it wrong I gave incorrect examples for diction and Figurative language I thought fig lang meant descriptions of actions fuck me Incoming C or D 
Michael Lu: You didn't have to do all the literary things tho 
Patrick Duan: Wat 
Michael Lu: He was just giving suggestions 
Patrick Duan: WAT 
Michael Lu: Pretty sure, "look for literary elements SUCH AS diction, figurative language, etc"

Michael Lu: Ok ð 
Patrick Duan: Cuz he thoight I was creative and artistic Tryna finish this shit Dude Have u ever done something u really regret 
Michael Lu: Yes Yes I have... 
Patrick Duan: Fuck dude same Can we both spill To let shit out Thatâs haunting 
Michael Lu: If it helps. 
Patrick Duan: I mean do u want me to go first 
Michael Lu: Iâll go. 
Patrick Duan: Alright Iâm all ears 
Michael Lu: I know youâre friends with the QB group, and this information concerns them, but donât tell them this. 
Patrick Duan: I gotchu 100% 
Michael Lu: I dig myself a social hole in middle school when I was hanging out with the GNS Communist Party. 
Patrick Duan: Ohh I mean youâve climbed out very well 
Michael Lu: Beyond the radical economic and social ideals, there was an underlying sentiment of elitism and arrogance; a sense that we were an oppressed nerd group who would one day rise up and use our superior birth given skills to advance ourselves and our cause. 
Patrick Duan: Oh I see Like yâall feel looked down upon by others And wanna prove them wrong and shit 
Michael Lu: And to counter that, we returned the favor. 
Patrick Duan: ???? 
Michael Lu: It sometimes became a cult fueled by envy for othersâ social superiority. 
Patrick Duan: Damnnn Wait what Is this still middle school Did u feel that way 
Michael Lu: And after 3 high school years of trying to remove the association and sentiment of the past, the fear of becoming the despised academic aristocrat still haunts me and drives me to act radically different in multiple situations. In losing my association with that group (who have also worked to better themselves as I believe), I lost my identity. And now I am but a fraud. 
Patrick Duan: Damn 
Michael Lu: Swaying wherever the wind blows. 
Patrick Duan: So who are you trying to be 
Michael Lu: The question is what am I trying to be. And the answer is a respectable man. But the dilemma is how that shall be achieved. 
Patrick Duan: U r respectable Much more than myself At this point youâre pretty high up 
Michael Lu: Iâm done, my best regards to the QB group whom I left, but never stopped admiring (most of the time). 
Patrick Duan: Wait you still care for them? Do you talk to them? 
Michael Lu: I donât really anymore. 
Patrick Duan: Do u wish to? 
Michael Lu: A great rift formed this year. 
Patrick Duan: Honestly I believe you should always do what you want and what you feel Like you may lose friends in the process but if theyâre holding u back from a greater happiness Then cut them off 
Michael Lu: I donât need friendship, I just want to be on good terms. 
Patrick Duan: Honestly They envy you Theyâre still in the shit hole and youâve been elevated to a throne 
Michael Lu: They may have caused certain events, but This was the past from which I sprang and formed. I donât look down on them Patrick. 
Patrick Duan: Hmmm 
Michael Lu: Donât make that mistake. 
Patrick Duan: Right So you just feel that they hurt ur rep right Honestly I felt that too 
Michael Lu: I hurt my rep more. 
Patrick Duan: Like they make weird noises and shit In public And sometimes I donât wanna be seen with them 
Michael Lu: They were just the environment that may have facilitated the social suicide. 
Patrick Duan: I used to care a lot about this Yea 
Michael Lu: There is no shame in association with them today though. I think they are becoming a respectable group. 
Patrick Duan: Really? Dude I hate how Iâm always associated with âQBâ Like I want some individualness Like Iâve grown to love and appreciate them as friends But This whole grouping thing really bothers me And my rep has been hurt 
Michael Lu: But do you care about your rep? 
Patrick Duan: Honestly not too much anymore I think Iâve given up Trying to be someone Iâm not Until... 
Michael Lu: Then donât let it determine your friends, donât become a fraud. 
Patrick Duan: Well that leads me to my testimony But finish urs first 
Michael Lu: Iâm done. 
Patrick Duan: Alright So Did I seem a bit off in English 
Michael Lu: Wdym? 
Patrick Duan: I fucking vape 
Michael Lu: I wouldnât be able to tell. 
Patrick Duan: Yea. Well Started like 2 days ago I was just curious Wanted try something new And I kept telling myself Iâd only do one But then I kept going day after day And today Almost smoked weed from a bong with kids But the weed was lost which saved me Like this shit is with like the popular Asians + some of the party white kids like Zeltzer And now idk wtf Iâve become My focus is rhined Ruined My work ethic damaged My whole perception of life has turned upside down A new detrimental element added to the equation Yea. 
Michael Lu: This is not the end. Nicotine is the only prominent drug in Vaping is it not? 
Patrick Duan: Yea itâs just nico Juul 
Michael Lu: Well why did you go back to vaping/attempting smoking? Was it the nicotine? Or was it the social aspect? 
Patrick Duan: Idk I think cuz I didnât get that satisfying feeling I was looking for Honestly I think itâs myself wanting to try everything In life But then now I feel âcoolerâ And accepted by those kids I want to go back I feel impure 
Michael Lu: You can become accepted while being clean (ex. Kenneth Tan). You donât have to adopt all customs of people to integrate. 
Patrick Duan: Yea true But idk if I even care that much about fitting in 
Michael Lu: Good. 
Patrick Duan: Ugh I just really wanna try shit Like itâs been like this my whole life Like Sunday Iâm gonna smoke weed but then I really Hope Iâm done 
Michael Lu: Would you want to quit? 
Patrick Duan: I guess so yea Does this shit really harm ur body that much 
Michael Lu: Well marijuana is a carcinogen. But the worst effect is on the mind. It detriments you human body slowly if used too often. 
Patrick Duan: uk what im done imma head back to my old life but now i can say i did something new instead of always living within boundaries 
Michael Lu: Boundaries can be good. They can be bad. 
Patrick Duan: hm 
Michael Lu: Be ambitious but be careful. Act Prudently (A P)... 
Patrick Duan: aight thanks man 
Michael Lu: Iâm not an expert on this stuff, but I hope just letting you express yourself helped somehow. 
Patrick Duan: Same to you 


Conversation:
Patrick Duan: yo for the lab #5... do u think this explanation is valid Energy conservation cannot be applied in the first part of the lab b/c you must be able to isolate Usp on side of the ME = ME equation (so itâs mgh = Usp)  in order to solve for it, which = Â½ K /\x^2 for solving for spring constant K â¦ 
â You cannot have an ME = ME equation where mgh = Usp at any two points along the spring for part 1 because with no external force (outside earth-spring-mass system) hold the mass at the relaxed (Usp = 0) like in part 2, you cannot have mgh = Usp from any two points for ME = ME â¦ 
â ME = ME, you need to have Usp = 0 (relaxed) while having mgh and no kinetic energy at one point, so you have just mgh, to then equal another point (at h = 0) where mgh = 0, and stopped moving (KE = 0), but have the spring stretched so Usp is nonzero, to be able to do mgh = Usp â¦ 
â In part 1, with no external force to hold the mass at rest at the relaxed length, there is no point where mgh exists while having no Usp and KE. So, you cannot get mgh = Usp here. The only time where there is no Usp in part 1 (no external hand force holding it at relaxed) is when the mass is not presentâ¦ which means mgh = 0 which cannot be used to solve â¦ 
â Therefore, the lack of presence of something like a hand exerting external force to hold the mass up while at relaxed length and at rest (like in part 2) means you can never locate 2 points for the ME = ME conservation of energy way of solving as you cannot get mgh = Usp anywhere â¦ 
â But you can if an external force keeps the mass at rest at the relaxed (mgh = nonzero, KE = 0, Usp = 0) and then letâs go to drop mass to h = 0 point (Usp = nonzero, mgh = 0, KE = 0), thus mgh(top point) = Usp(bottom h=0 point) as was in part 2. basically how the hand holds mass at rest allows there to be a point where mgh exists without Usp existing so you can do mgh = usp and solve while without the hand in part 1 you couldn't isolate usp alone to = mgh since you didn't have a time where mass was on spring without spring force 
Michael Lu: Yeah

Michael Lu: Wait what Can u contact them? Iâm pretty sure they know kids who ED Are not financially fucked U should be fine 
Patrick Duan: Should I call or email them

Patrick Duan: Fuck what should I say Cuz I can just withdraw my financial shit 
Michael Lu: lol idk 
Patrick Duan: Fuck. 
Michael Lu: Submit? 
Patrick Duan: I can change it 
Michael Lu: To no? 
Patrick Duan: Yea 
Michael Lu: Dam Iâd ask ur parents 
Patrick Duan: Cuz I can afford without it

Michael Lu: I mean u didnât donate a building 
Patrick Duan: And idk which that is 
Michael Lu: So being rich wonât be a deal breaker for u 
Patrick Duan: Yea but binding decision they wouldnât want a kid unsure of financial situation whoâs applying for financial aid right 
Michael Lu: Yeah I see TBH bud 
Patrick Duan: Shit man 
Michael Lu: Iâm not the guy to ask for ur finances 
Patrick Duan: LOL 
Michael Lu: Talk with ur parents 
Patrick Duan: I did They dk wtf to do 
Michael Lu: Superstitions say u should apply for no aid But do you wanna save a lot of money? This is ur future bro 
Patrick Duan: Yea but my mom said wtvr money I save thru aid she pays me back So itâs all on me If I wanna risk it to get money For a head start after graduation Or if I just wanna make sure my chances arenât affected Thatâs why i canât decide 
Michael Lu: TBH they rlly shouldnât be bro 
Patrick Duan: Cuz if ik I canât afford without aid Then Ofc I wouldnât back out of aid 
Michael Lu: Iâm sure financials is a minor thing if theyâre truly need blind Do some research Then make a decision I shouldnât be making it for u man This is ur future

Michael Lu: Ok Pat what's more scary A 6 Chapter Tria test Or a Dickson test 
Patrick Shen: a 6 chapter tria test gl buddy dont die this test aint even that bad i just dont like the integral part of it 
Michael Lu: Lol

Michael Lu: k thx 


Conversation:
Patrick Shen: yo litty ling for part A finding the Vi did u use average time or just choose one 
Michael Lu: I chose whatever time game me the smallest percent error 
Patrick Shen: boiii would it be wrong to just do the average 
Michael Lu: Prob not 
Patrick Shen: litty ling how did u linearize the thing did u set Y equals R and x to sin 2 theta 
Michael Lu: Yea 
Patrick Shen: Ok so is the slope positive 
Michael Lu: Hopefully 
Patrick Shen: Did u use -9.8 for the g Cuz don't u want the vi to be positive Slope = vi squared / g If g is -9.8 shouldn't the slope be negative so u can get a positive vi 
Michael Lu: I used 9.8 positive But vi is at an angle 
Patrick Shen: Why positive 9.8 
Michael Lu: So idk if you can attribute a sign to an angled vector 
Patrick Shen: What do u mean Why not 
Michael Lu: You got a negative vi? 
Patrick Shen: No I didn't Wait for the equation 
Michael Lu: What was your g 
Patrick Shen: Is the vi regular vi Or vix Or what G is always -9.8 is it not 
Michael Lu: "Full magnitude of initial velocity vector" 
Patrick Shen: What does that mean lol English please 
Michael Lu: V in the equation is the initial velocity (combined x and y) 
Patrick Shen: Ok gotchu And why is ur g positive 
Michael Lu: Is yours negative? 
Patrick Shen: Yes?.... Isn't it always -9.8 Cuz gravity OH WAIT do we calculate g By plugging in numbers 
Michael Lu: No you calculate v 
Patrick Shen: So what is g then Like isn't it always -9.8 
Michael Lu: Ppl online use positive 9.8 
Patrick Shen: Why tho 
Michael Lu: If they used negative they'd get negative answers which doesn't make sense 
Patrick Shen: What the Physics is fake Lmao My data was trash tho Like this is supposed to be a negative slope 
Michael Lu: Saem 
Patrick Shen: Ok idk why they used positive 9.8 for g but ok 
Michael Lu: Eveybody had positive slopes 
Patrick Shen: Wait does this look positive to u tho 
Michael Lu: Yea 
Patrick Shen: Lmfao OH SHIT I DIDNT DO SIN 2 theta I just did theta vs range lmfao Ez pz 
Michael Lu: Hmm maybe because range is a scalar So it has to be positive So g has to be plugged in positive 
Patrick Shen: Oh I see Yeah actually true Damn litty I see u Ok thanks bruh 
Michael Lu: The internet doesn't have a good answer, that's just my 2 cents No prob 
Patrick Shen: :) to calculate the vi for part 2 u use the slope u got from the linearized equation right u dont plug in r and theta values 
Michael Lu: Yah use slope 
Patrick Shen: kk thanks boi i got like 6 pts off last time cuz i replugged in r and theta values he was like just use the slope from the linearized equation... wait wait how do u calculate percent difference is that the same as percent error COME BACK LITTY ah yeet hi 
Michael Lu: Nah john Wong just told me it was different lmao 
Patrick Shen: ik he asked me so im asking u 
Michael Lu: I looked it up They're different 
Patrick Shen: ok so how do u do it 
Michael Lu: Abs(difference)/avg * 100 
Patrick Shen: wat whats the average so if ur percentage is like 18 and 20 the difference is 2 
Michael Lu: Yeah divide by 19 
Patrick Shen: ohhh which one is more accurate and why 
Michael Lu: Projectile 
Patrick Shen: why 
Michael Lu: Idk air resistance? I couldn't think of a good explanation 
Patrick Shen: ugh rip ok both assumes no air resistance thats why its 9.8 still so u cant say air resistance right 
Michael Lu: Idk 
Patrick Shen: lmao rip ok nvm then 
Michael Lu: I just put down like wind or some stuff 
Patrick Shen: LMFAO lynne said free fall has less room for error free fall has 1 variable projectile has 2 
Michael Lu: Okay seems legit 
Patrick Shen: what did u put for error what are sources of error 
Michael Lu: Air resistance and wind 
Patrick Shen: ok wait litty which equation did u do the get the first initial velocity d= vit one or did u do vf = vi using half trip 
Michael Lu: d = vi * t + 1/2 * g * t^2 
Patrick Shen: cool gotchu 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: These are all the tests we learned right? 
Patrick Shen: what is the absolute value ratio test... 
Michael Lu: Ratio test with absolute value signs 
Patrick Shen: isnt that basically the absolute convergence test 
Michael Lu: Is it? 
Patrick Shen: eh sorta 
Michael Lu: Woah teach me pls :/ 
Patrick Shen: absolute convergence test is basically just saying if the absolute value of the series converges then so does the regular series 
Michael Lu: But there's no p value 
Patrick Shen: and then absolute value ratio test is saying if the absolute convergence test is absolutely diverging, you can figure out if the sequence diverges or converges  using the ratio test yeah so they are kinda linked I think thats right??? not 100% sure 
Michael Lu: K 
Patrick Shen: does that sound right 
Michael Lu: Yah but idk if they're the same 
Patrick Shen: yeah..... idk ask someone and lmk what htey say yo litty n/2n lim as n goes to infinity of n/2n does that converge to 1/2 
Michael Lu: The lim is 1/2 yah 
Patrick Shen: tf so the divergence test says it diverges right 
Michael Lu: Yah 
Patrick Shen: or im confused does the sequence approach 0 its 1/2 1/4 1/6 1/8 it keeps getting smaller 
Michael Lu: The sequence n/2n ??? 
Patrick Shen: yes oh wait SHIT nvm 
Michael Lu: Umm it's always 1/2 right? 
Patrick Shen: oh fuck wait yeah disregard what i wrote above so doesnt it converge to 1/ 1/2 cuz its always 1/2 oh wait nvm 
Michael Lu: The sequence converges to 1/2 the series doesn't 
Patrick Shen: right nvm i see thanks litty yo if u have a series like 1/(x+6) besides comparison tests can u get rid of the 6 and be like its x^1 so it diverges by the p series test litty get back here we need a math nerd 
Michael Lu: Lol no not really since those series aren't that related 
Patrick Shen: Okie thanks

Michael Lu: Did u have gram last year? 
Patrick Shen: No I have him this year 
Michael Lu: Ok 


Conversation:
Patrick Shen: yo litty ling 
Michael Lu: u wot m8? 
Patrick Shen: how does newtons second law have anything to do with ramp angle 
Michael Lu: increase ramp angle increases Fnet which increases a 
Patrick Shen: why does increasing ramp angle increase fnet 
Michael Lu: It's steeper 
Patrick Shen: what the fuck is that some like math wizardry . no comment is the fnet here just friction force which is mgsin theta 
Michael Lu: fnet is the force that pulls the box down the incline 
Patrick Shen: oh shit yeah friction force is negliglible ohhh ok i get it where the fuck did u get this shit from if u actually thought of this urself ur insane lmao ok thanks 
Michael Lu: np 
Patrick Shen: #praiselitty also did u fail math as badly as u thought lol ethan wang with the 1 0 0 
Michael Lu: yas 
Patrick Shen: awww its ok time to drop i got a flat 70 lmfaooo cuz i got number 5 and 7 wrong 7 points off each b o i Sad life wait 1 more thing does mass impact acceleration 
Michael Lu: No 
Patrick Shen: k good thanks 
Michael Lu: No prob 
Patrick Shen: yo litty ling is this right The gravity force does not act directly in the direction of motion, but is responsible for creating a net force in that direction since the definition of net force is the vector sum of all forces (a representation of the total forces) while the direction of motion depends on the direction of each individual force canceling out. In this particular situation, the net force is made up of the normal force, gravity force, and friction force. As shown earlier, the net forces and gravity forces cancel out while the friction forces is negligible. However, the gravity forces is made up of the x component and y component (only the x component cancels out). Therefore, the gravity force indirectly impacts the direction of motion causing the cart to go right by the y component of gravity and directly impact the net force since gravity force + normal force + negligible friction force = net force. 
Michael Lu: Did u talk to John Wong? Looks legit m8 ð 
Patrick Shen: wait really? yeah i did talk to him is that actually right ayyyyyyyyy 
Michael Lu: I hope 
Patrick Shen: i looked it up online lmao so it should be 


Conversation:
Patrick Shen: how do u do number 2 for the webassign like whats the fbd 
Michael Lu: Idk if our numbers and directions match up 
Patrick Shen: howd u do the math tho i get that 
Michael Lu: Pythagoras's stuff And the direction of the 3rd vector is opposite the direction of the resultant of the first two vectors. 
Patrick Shen: ok i kinda get it why is it not just simply 7.7-4.1 tho 
Michael Lu: ? Then what would the answer be? 
Patrick Shen: 3.6 like isnt Fnet 0 
Michael Lu: You can only subtract magnitudes of vectors acting in the same direction 
Patrick Shen: oh really? i thought it was like if u have Fn, Fg, friction and applied force u can just add all of it up to get Fnet 
Michael Lu: Remember last unit with vector math, you can't simply add the velocity of the stream with the velocity of a boat crossing the stream 
Patrick Shen: lmao i wasnt there in class on that day so i didnt actually learn it lmfao 
Michael Lu: Fnet is the sum of all the force vectors but adding vectors isn't as simple as adding their magnitudes 
Patrick Shen: oh so even for my example 
Michael Lu: That's why in class, you don't really add gravity to horizontal friction, they operate in different directions 
Patrick Shen: ohhhhhh ok i see so u need to do the resultant shit 
Michael Lu: Yeah unfortunately life is hard 
Patrick Shen: ssigh ok thanks how do u do #6 when u have that 1 question u cant get k m s 
Michael Lu: Send a pic Speed is positive 
Patrick Shen: wait a minute dont tell me its just 8.72... 
Michael Lu: Idk tell me what u did 
Patrick Shen: so first 2 seconds is -9.8 times 2 and then next 8 seconds is ur acceleration times 8 u know the Fnet is 84 i added -19.6 + 10.88 and got -8.72 
Michael Lu: How many tries do u have 
Patrick Shen: 6 more 
Michael Lu: Ok try 8.72 
Patrick Shen: oh wait it is 8.72 HAT THE FUKK why 
Michael Lu: Speed 
Patrick Shen: is it just speed thats why fuck ths shit lol im dumb ok thanks 
Michael Lu: Lol 


Conversation:
Patrick Shen: Yo litty why is it no change doesnt moving at a faster constant speed mean that there was a greater pull force 
Michael Lu: Yeah but it's still at a constant speed 
Patrick Shen: im confuzzled that means A=0 
Michael Lu: TBH the question is poorly worded 
Patrick Shen: true 
Michael Lu: I think it's asking how the acceleration is different between situations 
Patrick Shen: but like shouldnt ur friction force be greater cuz ur pull force is greater pull force in this case is the intial pull to get the box moving so a faster constant speed does impact the results right is that logic correct lol 
Michael Lu: The acceleration is still 0 that's what wells cared about here Pull force is not initial pull 
Patrick Shen: pull force isnt the initial pull here? wat 
Michael Lu: It's still there always, just cancelled out by friction 
Patrick Shen: oh wait i see he would have to say there is a pull force like initial 
Michael Lu: Yeah I guess 
Patrick Shen: ok thanks are we on quiz 5 or quiz 6 
Michael Lu: 5 
Patrick Shen: ok

Patrick Shen: test 3 and 4 from last yera? year* or just 3 
Michael Lu: Wit 
Patrick Shen: for last year which one is it 
Michael Lu: Did you look at them yet? 
Patrick Shen: it says dynamics 1 and 2 
Michael Lu: Did you look at the questions yet? 
Patrick Shen: ye 
Michael Lu: If they both apply then just do both bud 
Patrick Shen: u can do both true ok 
Michael Lu: Lol 4 looks not legit 
Patrick Shen: wot lol we can do like half of it 


Conversation:
Patrick Shen: yo litty ling did u do the webassign 
Michael Lu: Did 
Patrick Shen: for nmber 5 is the F friction 
Michael Lu: Send pic 
Patrick Shen: like im confused how to draw the friction on the fbd 
Michael Lu: The original question F is not friction 
Patrick Shen: am i correct in my bd fbd 
Michael Lu: Looks good 
Patrick Shen: ok thanks 
Michael Lu: Okay Did you like 
Patrick Shen: ? 
Michael Lu: Attempt the question? 
Patrick Shen: si 
Michael Lu: Did it work? 
Patrick Shen: no lmao i think i plugged in a number wrong 
Michael Lu: Okay 
Patrick Shen: imma redo it 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Pat Tell wells to post the webass Nvm 
Patrick Shen: lmfao 


Conversation:
Patrick Shen: yo is there three different net forces now? Fnet c Fnet x and Fnet y 
Michael Lu: No 
Patrick Shen: is dat how it works im confuzzled for the first webassign question that asked if there was Fnet i know that just cuz its moving constant speed doesnt mean that there is no acceleration 
Michael Lu: There is only one Fnet Fnet 
Patrick Shen: Fnet (c)? 
Michael Lu: Yeah That exists 
Patrick Shen: what about tangential acceleration there is Fnet x and Fnet y still 
Michael Lu: Whatâs x and y 
Patrick Shen: wot the x and y direction for looking at tangential acceleration 
Michael Lu: What does that mean buddy? Where does x point? :( 
Patrick Shen: true ok so what do u do if u have both tangential acceleration and centripetal and we are working with forces in the tangential direction 
Michael Lu: Acceleration is the resultant 
Patrick Shen: what Fnet do u use 
Michael Lu: Fnet is the resultant of all forces 
Patrick Shen: the fuk so its not Fnet (c)? 
Michael Lu: Fnet is made up of the centripetal (Fnet c) and tangential force 
Patrick Shen: o ok so there is a general Fnet for all the forces OH WAIT 
Michael Lu: Yeah I guess 
Patrick Shen: is centripetal just Fnet X and Tangential just fnet y 
Michael Lu: Yeah if you define it that way 
Patrick Shen: oh i seee OHHHH ok did u do the webassig webassign #2? idk wtf im doing wrong 
Michael Lu: Okay 
Patrick Shen: is there just Fg and Ft forces 
Michael Lu: Umm Send a pic Did you use the weight of the ball 
Patrick Shen: No I divided by 9.8 
Michael Lu: Why Itâs a horizontal circle 
Patrick Shen: Cuz it's mass.... 
Michael Lu: No fcks given about gravity 
Patrick Shen: What 
Michael Lu: If its horizontal in physics 1 Like I mean did you use gravity as a force 
Patrick Shen: Oh No 
Michael Lu: Okay Good 
Patrick Shen: LMAO 
Michael Lu: How did u do the math 
Patrick Shen: I solved for V Lol 
Michael Lu: Err Dafuq 
Patrick Shen: OH FUCK I WROTE 5.44 My calculator says 4.54 LOL 
Michael Lu: Noice Yah the numbers look sis 
Patrick Shen: I'm Fucking Dyslexic 
Michael Lu: Dsylixea 
Patrick Shen: L m a o wait as u move through a circle the velocity can increase right and are the velocities the same magnitude at top and bottom of circle nvm figured it out the second part that how does velocity change throughout a circle? does it get less? 
Michael Lu: Itâs direction changes. If itâs speed doesnât change the magnitude of velocity doesnât change. 
Patrick Shen: Ok Nah but is there a way to find out speed change when u have both tangential and centripetal 
Michael Lu: :/ Wdym 
Patrick Shen: Nvm I'll just ask wells 
Michael Lu: You mean tangential acceleration? 
Patrick Shen: Kind of 
Michael Lu: Do you mean the total acceleration? 
Patrick Shen: I'll just ask wells nvm it's a bit confusing 
Michael Lu: Ok ð gl 
Patrick Shen: Thanks yo for number 8 how did u draw the fbd 
Michael Lu: send a pic idk i don't draw fbds... 
Patrick Shen: tf how did u do this then 
Michael Lu: hold on 
Patrick Shen: is there Fg fn and fs 
Michael Lu: what does your fbd look like fg and fn should be coming out of the page 
Patrick Shen: I'm confused in general lmao Wdym 
Michael Lu: the dude is turning around a curve gravity and normal act up and down 
Patrick Shen: Um wot So is my gravity wrong 
Michael Lu: it lowkey shouldn't be there 
Patrick Shen: Tf Wait how do u do this question 
Michael Lu: it's a standard centripetal force problem you just gotta know what force is the centripetal force 
Patrick Shen: Fs right 
Michael Lu: yah 
Patrick Shen: But not fs mac Max U don't know what fs is tho 
Michael Lu: well it is fs max 
Patrick Shen: Wot It is?? Wells wrote 
Michael Lu: it asks for maximum speed 
Patrick Shen: "Fs" So generally Fs is pushing u in But maximum speed is always fs max 
Michael Lu: friction yah puts you in a turn 
Patrick Shen: What happens if it goes to kinetic friction 
Michael Lu: yah because the higher speed requires more friction 
Patrick Shen: Would u not make the turn? 
Michael Lu: i think so 
Patrick Shen: damn ok 
Michael Lu: you'd go straight or smthng 
Patrick Shen: Ok thx Wait just to get an understand Understanding Where is fg and fn Sorry lol ik it's not relevant But how do they look Is it along the tangential? Is there even fn in the first place? 
Michael Lu: fg goes down right 
Patrick Shen: Yep How about fn 
Michael Lu: yeah so it goes down into the ground 
Patrick Shen: Oh wait 
Michael Lu: which you can't draw on a 2D iPad 
Patrick Shen: So it's like OHHHH 
Michael Lu: same with normal it goes up 
Patrick Shen: the fg I drew Is wrong That's showing it's going backwards Ok 
Michael Lu: Fg and Fn shouldn't be there 
Patrick Shen: Right Ok Ty 
Michael Lu: np 
Patrick Shen: Lmfao I totally bsed this how do I do it 
Michael Lu: find the release speed bc after the slide the girl is a 2D projectile so find Vi first 
Patrick Shen: yah did i not do that 
Michael Lu: idk i can't read ur handwriting 
Patrick Shen: oh i used the vf squared equation  to find Viy and then i used vx= dxt oh before using that i found the time too using y equation and then i found vx and then idk what to do lmfao does vx^2 + vy^2 = Vi^2 
Michael Lu: yeah but there is no vy at the start 
Patrick Shen: wot 
Michael Lu: Vi = Vx when the gorilla is in the 6:00 position the tangent line is horizontal the velocity is tangent to the circle, so it's all horizontal 
Patrick Shen: so how do u find time d= vit + 1/2at^2? 
Michael Lu: yah 
Patrick Shen: and plug in 0 for vi 
Michael Lu: yah 
Patrick Shen: kk ty wait is acceleration -9.8 still 
Michael Lu: yes 
Patrick Shen: tf 
Michael Lu: once you let go 
Patrick Shen: im getting a negative square root yeah ik but then it becomes d= 1/2 at^2 
Michael Lu: did you plug in -10 for d 
Patrick Shen: which is not possible OH SHIT my b #predictions lmao still wrong isnt it Ft= fg + mv^2?(r) 
Michael Lu: :/ 
Patrick Shen: where you find v from horizontal projectile i got 51.48 for v 
Michael Lu: Wat Whatâs your time 
Patrick Shen: 1.43 seconds 
Michael Lu: Divide the x distance by that 
Patrick Shen: wot isnt it vx= dxt or am i wrong lmfao 
Michael Lu: No itâs d = vx * t 
Patrick Shen: holyyyy fuck this shit 
Michael Lu: d = r * t ? 
Patrick Shen: wait that makes sense got it ayyy did u do the mc can i check mine with urs b4 i submit lol I just fucking realized The webass is due next week HOLY I'm done I didn't study for my test cuz of this shit FUCKKKK 


Conversation:
Patrick Shen: yo what values did u end up using since our data is wrong for the diameter 
Michael Lu: 0.7 or smthing for the diameter 
Patrick Shen: i just made it up lmfao i did 1 what was ur reasons for error and ways to improve can u say that it wasnt a perfectly horizontal circle since mg could be acting not straight down and have components 
Michael Lu: Idk if wells would buy that 
Patrick Shen: u g h what did u say 
Michael Lu: Idk Not circle We suck at measuring 
Patrick Shen: i guess for the acceleration calculation can u just do ft-fg/mass rather than doing a= v^2/r Idk why it came out so high... 
Michael Lu: Ok whatevs I got that 
Patrick Shen: LMAOO 


Conversation:
Patrick Shen: There was no proofs right Wtfff I spent so long memorizing them 
Michael Lu: Yes 
Patrick Shen: yo litty ling what was the answer to number 15 of the webassign 
Michael Lu: Send a pic 
Patrick Shen: is there centripetal at the max cuz technically isnt it still in motion? is it E or C 
Michael Lu: lol apparently itâs C 
Patrick Shen: yeah ok thats what i thought maximum point doesnt have centripetal righ 
Michael Lu: I think 
Patrick Shen: yep 
Michael Lu: It shouldnât according to TIPERS 
Patrick Shen: thats right why not lol what did the tipers say 
Michael Lu: At max height v=0 So plugging into equation yields 0 
Patrick Shen: hmm yeah thats weird tf lemme ask wells 
Michael Lu: Ik Thatâs why idk webassign 
Patrick Shen: imma ask jon wong first and then ask wells wait just to confirm can u show me which tipers questin question* 
Michael Lu: Ummm where do you find it? It was the one where you had to label the acceleration of a pendulum. 
Patrick Shen: Ok 


Conversation:
Patrick Shen: yo can u explain 18 for the mc what force is causing the tangential acceleration 
Michael Lu: S E N D NU PICTURE IF WEBASSIGB 
Patrick Shen: lmao 
Michael Lu: Did u try it 
Patrick Shen: Well yeah It's 2 but like I don't get why What's the force 
Michael Lu: Normal Of the hand 
Patrick Shen: Tf oh shittt Gravity goes out of paper right 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Patrick Shen: And tension force (?) is the arm Kinda Right The centripetal force Is the arm tension force 
Michael Lu: Yeah but the tension doesnât go to the center of the thingy 
Patrick Shen: Wait wot What does that mean then 
Michael Lu: the centripetal force is provided by the arm 
Patrick Shen: ohhhh ok thanks yo does fnet c ever equal 0 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Patrick Shen: when 
Michael Lu: When something is not moving in a circle 
Patrick Shen: oh . LOL ok 
Michael Lu: Or when v = 0 
Patrick Shen: gotchu 
Michael Lu: Like the pendulum 
Patrick Shen: ohhhhhhhhh okie Yo can u explain the last mc It's weird 
Michael Lu: You remember the car going over he bump I think itâs like that 
Patrick Shen: Hmmm really?? Lemme check 
Michael Lu: Fg > Fn since the thing needs to stay moving in a circle 
Patrick Shen: Yep 
Michael Lu: So Fn < Fg which makes you seem lighter 
Patrick Shen: It's like elevator questions I think Right? 
Michael Lu: Well elevator doesnât move in circle 
Patrick Shen: Oh true 
Michael Lu: But I guess yah kinda 
Patrick Shen: Ok thanks I tried drawing a horizontal circle LOL to label rotation i hate elevator webassign 
Michael Lu: Yes Ikr 
Patrick Shen: How do u do it Like the minimum speed Minimum scale reading is when acceleration is negative And u know the mass How do u figure out the a value Is it not just -6 
Michael Lu: Wut 
Patrick Shen: Nvm I'll ask wells 
Michael Lu: Use kinematic 
Patrick Shen: OH I see ok thx 
Michael Lu: Did you try an answer? 
Patrick Shen: I got an answer that wasn't on it lol 
Michael Lu: Dam 
Patrick Shen: Mhm ok ty anyways 


Conversation:
Patrick Shen: yo did u do the math hw 
Michael Lu: Which one fam 
Patrick Shen: related rates how do u do the question... i need an example lol he didnt really go over it well in class 
Michael Lu: Any particular problem number? 
Patrick Shen: 2 part a is fine just need an idea of what to do 
Michael Lu: Did you get the given info 
Patrick Shen: wdym did i get it? i have it lol 
Michael Lu: They gave you one rate in part b right 
Patrick Shen: ummm they gave me this 
Michael Lu: Yeah So they gave you that dy/dt = 4 
Patrick Shen: yep 
Michael Lu: Yeah so you do implicit differentiation of the given equation With respect to t 
Patrick Shen: but i dont get how to do it tho its weird cuz u have different variables now can u like show me the work for one question so i can figure it out kinda 
Michael Lu: Ok 
Patrick Shen: thanks ohhhh ok thanks its weird tho why is it just d/dt what happened to the dx or dy what did u get for 2a.. i got -1/4 i think thats wrong nvm nvm im good thanks litty!!! 


Conversation:
Patrick Shen: yo for number 5 on the lab how did u do it did u use average power 
Michael Lu: Sure 
Patrick Shen: ok cool thanks yo litty for ur average velocity did u just do v= d/t or did u find v and then do vI + vf/2 wait nvm i figured it out LOL 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Pattytt 
Patrick Shen: yes do u know da wae 
Michael Lu: Do you know da wae To solve #42 
Patrick Shen: what pg 
Michael Lu: Pg 683 or smthing At extra help 
Patrick Shen: oh p = infinity 
Michael Lu: The Lagrange Error thing 
Patrick Shen: uhhh the one with ln? 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Patrick Shen: uhh we just did alternating series test LOL we looked at the next omitted term we didnt use legrange 
Michael Lu: Whatâs the answer/setup 
Patrick Shen: absolute value of (-x^4/4) is less than or equal to 0.0005 
Michael Lu: Lol ok 
Patrick Shen: mhm 
Michael Lu: Like that 
Patrick Shen: yeah it is 
Michael Lu: And thatâs the answer 
Patrick Shen: we didnt solve but yeah 
Michael Lu: He never taught us that tho Lol whatevs Iâll just study tmrw 
Patrick Shen: looooolz 


Conversation:
Patrick Shen: yo litty wanna help me with webass can u explain tje ,c 
Michael Lu: Deadass 
Patrick Shen: the mc* 16 
Michael Lu: What did u choose 
Patrick Shen: Equal I guessed lol 
Michael Lu: Well time of force is the same right? 
Patrick Shen: tf what does this have to do with force 
Michael Lu: Time 
Patrick Shen: and time 
Michael Lu: Time is the same Right bruv? 
Patrick Shen: uhhh how do u know that 
Michael Lu: Because itâs time The duration of the contact is the same for both Right? 
Patrick Shen: uhhh is it idk i guess 
Michael Lu: Yeah when I touch something, my finger stays on it for x seconds 
Patrick Shen: ok so then what 
Michael Lu: The thing I touched felt my finger for x seconds So time is the same And then for force The car pushes truck Truck pushes car 
Patrick Shen: so action reaction forces the impulse is always equal 
Michael Lu: Yah which are equal in magnitude Yah bc time and magnitude of force is equal 
Patrick Shen: they are just always opposite signs 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Patrick Shen: ok and then what about 13 bouncing off vertical wall 
Michael Lu: Imagine the ball is like a wind particle And t hits the wall So the thing moves left But the net movement is no movement I think

Patrick Shen: okie 
Michael Lu: Patrick 7a on webassign is no Itâs one try 
Patrick Shen: ? Wait what 
Michael Lu: One try multiple choice Make sure you put no 
Patrick Shen: Wtff LOL Thanks bro looking out for me 
Michael Lu: Yah 
Patrick Shen: Ty ty 
Michael Lu: Yo pattttt 
Patrick Shen: sup 
Michael Lu: What did ur impulses for the lab look like? 
Patrick Shen: which part 
Michael Lu: Rn I have over 100% error Part I 
Patrick Shen: wtf i have 0.501 and 0.328 
Michael Lu: Lol oh sheeet 
Patrick Shen: btw whats the delta p for that part 1 
Michael Lu: Itâs mass * delta v 
Patrick Shen: like was the initial momentum zero? oh 
Michael Lu: Initial momentum wasnât zero 
Patrick Shen: ok and how do u do the percent diffrence like what do u plug in lmfao 
Michael Lu: (Value 1 - value 2)/avg Times 10 100* 
Patrick Shen: wtf are we calculating percent difference for delta p? 
Michael Lu: J = delta p Theoretically So your recorded impulse should equal your delta p Ideally 
Patrick Shen: ummmm really? LOL OH SHIT 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Patrick Shen: I HAVE 0% error LITTY TITTY l o l 
Michael Lu: Lmao So jelly 
Patrick Shen: lelelelel so percent difference is comparing ur delta p to the impulse recorded right shittt holy fuck 0% error we gods 
Michael Lu: Weâre your vi and vf equal in magnitude Or almost equal in mag Part I 
Patrick Shen: no 0.554 and 0.448 0.374 and 0.281 
Michael Lu: Basically equal tho 
Patrick Shen: LOL i guess so my delta v was 1.002 and 0,655 and times 0.5 mass is same as my impulse wtf LOL nice numbers 
Michael Lu: XD 


Conversation:
Patrick Shen: yo litty why is 7 no i dont get why ME is not conserved the system is correct 
Michael Lu: I think it has to do with type of collision 
Patrick Shen: wdym i dont get it 
Michael Lu: If the gun sticks Itâs a perfectly inelastic collision right 
Patrick Shen: oh right i see ok thanks its not cuz of the gum being a nonconservative force right wtf get that theo kid outta ma face 
Michael Lu: Kinetic energy is not conserved in perfectly inelastic collisions 
Patrick Shen: kk can u help me with 13 i dont get it yo necessito mucho help i dont get the situation nor do i get how to do it 
Michael Lu: Okay ð Umm Send me a pic of your first attempt 
Patrick Shen: i think i got it wait now i dont get 14 
Michael Lu: Umm Whichever has bigger change in momentum Has bigger impulse Has bigger force Has bigger effect on wall 
Patrick Shen: ok right so 
Michael Lu: ( ð°ï¸ ) 
Patrick Shen: just bigger force equals stronger push on wall? lol thats the part i dont get 
Michael Lu: If you have a bigger impulse you have a bigger force And the force is an action reaction 
Patrick Shen: right OH ACTION REACTION is it same time 
Michael Lu: Yeah prob 
Patrick Shen: how do u know 
Michael Lu: Both enter at same velocity I guess 
Patrick Shen: ok i gotchu also what about 16 
Michael Lu: Send a pic pls I canât load webasssign on mobile Boi Try it first Then ask 
Patrick Shen: i did do u use j= m delta v 
Michael Lu: Like Put an answer 
Patrick Shen: aight gotchu lol i guessed it right i wrote equal idk why explain? 
Michael Lu: Action reaction Force equal 
Patrick Shen: u dont know time tho oh ait wait i get it same time cuz action reaction oh, 
Michael Lu: Yeah two things have to be in contact for the same time 
Patrick Shen: can u use momentum to explain like using velocity 
Michael Lu: U donât know enough info I think 
Patrick Shen: oh i see ok

Patrick Shen: can we use n^nfepl on this midterm lololol 
Michael Lu: Nah 
Patrick Shen: wtf srsly? GODDAMIT but weiss lets them use it 
Michael Lu: But Dickson dont 
Patrick Shen: true ugh fuck 
Michael Lu: Like the AP wouldnât let it anyways 
Patrick Shen: I guess R u ready I just want a mid B on this lmfao 
Michael Lu: Lol seniors 
Patrick Shen: true Good luck man This test is gonna be rough 
Michael Lu: U too 
Patrick Shen: Thanks is the stuff we learned last week is that on the test 
Michael Lu: Umm ask Weiss kids 
Patrick Shen: asfsadfsd rip 
Michael Lu: It prob not 
Patrick Shen: ok goodz 
Michael Lu: If Dickson made the test early enough? 
Patrick Shen: true How do u do 3a and 3b LMAO I FORGOT how do u know where it's continuous Just look at the graph? 
Michael Lu: Look at the functions that make up f(x) This was non calculator test 
Patrick Shen: Right So u split it up How did u know tan Or inverse sin 
Michael Lu: A functions range is the inverseâs domain 
Patrick Shen: Oh Got it Ok thanks How about this one 4a Idk how to do it cuz it's to the lnx power So it gets confusing 
Michael Lu: U log it 
Patrick Shen: Can u show me the work I don't get how Wait can u show me part b too lol U did it differently than I thought How do u take the derivative of that inverse trig Do u use this 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Patrick Shen: ok ty

Michael Lu: Oh sheeb U rite We do 
Patrick Shen: ye 


Conversation:
Patrick Shen: how do u do #4 for the webassign 
Michael Lu: Use given period in spring equation to solve for mass After I solve for k U* 
Patrick Shen: But which mass is that tho Like why do they ask for two masses mass of total load and mass of car? Aren't they same 
Michael Lu: Mass of total load is car + 2 ppl 
Patrick Shen: ohhhhh Ok ok gotchu thanks is delta x meter or cm idk why but im not getting the right answer its Fsp= k delta x 
Michael Lu: Meter 
Patrick Shen: Fg = k delta x did u plug in the two people combined mass for the m 
Michael Lu: ? 
Patrick Shen: like how did u solve for k did u use Fg = k delta x 
Michael Lu: To solve for k I think I used two ppl mass How many tries do u got 
Patrick Shen: 5 left how do u find the mass of the car 
Michael Lu: Subtract total mass and ppl mass 
Patrick Shen: HOLY IM A DUMBASS how tf do u do 9 + 10 
Michael Lu: 19 
Patrick Shen: loooooooool imma just do it tom after math test fuk dat are there any proofs on this test 
Michael Lu: I donât think s 
Patrick Shen: okie thanks both rolle and mvt needs to be continuous and differentiable over that interval specified right otherwise u just say the theorem does not apply 
Michael Lu: Yessir 
Patrick Shen: kk :O is it just me or is this test going to be very straightforward like one question per topic and they wont be that bad 
Michael Lu: Straighter than a linear line 
Patrick Shen: only one might be the word problem for applied min/max looool right LMFAO thats the only topic i haven't studied yet Why is it 10-h /r And not h/r I don't get the similar proportion we set up here 
Michael Lu: H is just the tiny section at the bottom Thatâs not what we were looking for 
Patrick Shen: what tiny section im confused what is H in the picture 
Michael Lu: h* 
Patrick Shen: yeah whats h yes what is that for the picture of the cylinder in the cone i dont see it visually lmfao 
Michael Lu: If u use h Then ur not using similar triangles 
Patrick Shen: isnt h the height of the cylinder and 10-h is the top space 
Michael Lu: Yeah but u want to create a formula for h based on similar triangles 
Patrick Shen: why cant u use h 
Michael Lu: so you use 10 - h 
Patrick Shen: ugh i dont get why 
Michael Lu: h is just a segment of 10 You canât form a triangle with just h You can only get a trapezoid 
Patrick Shen: oh i see ok How do u know which variable to eliminate For those questions Is there an easy way 
Michael Lu: Algebraic foresight 
Patrick Shen: Lol Ok 
Michael Lu: There is no way 
Patrick Shen: And last thing 
Michael Lu: Or I do not know the way 
Patrick Shen: For open intervals Even if u don't check the end points Why do we take the limits of the endpoint To see if it's only one min or max? To see if it makes sense? Cuz if both endpoints go to infinity or negative infinity there is only one max or min 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Patrick Shen: But what if one goes to infinity and the other goes to negative infinity Does that mean anything 
Michael Lu: No min or max 
Patrick Shen: Oh shit Wait really? Oh yeah Then it's relative So that means there is no answer LMFAO 
Michael Lu: Yep 
Patrick Shen: so it should always be both positive infinity or negative infinity For the word problems Otherwise u have no answer 
Michael Lu: Yeah if the limits end up that way Same end behavior 
Patrick Shen: Kk Thanks 
Michael Lu: Yuppp 
Patrick Shen: yo litty for max and min word problems usually cost is open interval right and then u can always check if it is a max or min by finding the y value or doing second derivative to check the concavity like in the answer key why does he do second derivative cant we just plug in the x values into the original equation and look at which y values are greater as long as its in the interval lmao sorry last question b4 i sleep 
Michael Lu: Yea but u plug it in to compare to end points 
Patrick Shen: Wdym To look at concavity right 
Michael Lu: Derivative tests can only give whether something is a relative max So you can get multiple relative maxes and mins But only one is the greatest max 
Patrick Shen: Oh 
Michael Lu: And only one is the leastiest min 
Patrick Shen: Ok gotcha And are cost questions mainly open interval For max min word problems 
Michael Lu: Idk are they? 
Patrick Shen: Well we had 2 And both were 
Michael Lu: Why 
Patrick Shen: Cuz it only gave us cost No radius or anything So we could have an infinity boundary 
Michael Lu: But wdym itâs open? Like parenthesis? 
Patrick Shen: Oh not open Like (0, infinity) As opposed to [0,8] For radius of a circle For finding the x value in a max min problem 
Michael Lu: To find the bounds just use logic idek 
Patrick Shen: I guess 
Michael Lu: Like if ur cost can be negative Then it donât make sense 
Patrick Shen: Yeah true 
Michael Lu: So u limit the bounds of the cost function So that donât happen 
Patrick Shen: ok gotchu

Patrick Shen: where is max displacement for a pendulum 
Michael Lu: Hurr? 
Patrick Shen: number 9 on the webassign Wait nvm Kimberly got it 


Conversation:
Patrick Shen: how do u do 14c and 14d looool 
Michael Lu: C - solve their zeros of the equations 
Patrick Shen: wtf i did that isnt it cos 90 thats the first point where it hits 0 
Michael Lu: yeah 
Patrick Shen: so u find the time that makes the inside the circle equal 90 wtfff 
Michael Lu: Wait time might be in radians 
Patrick Shen: wot how 
Michael Lu: Like set the crap = pi/2 
Patrick Shen: oh shit ur right idk why but ok and what about d is it just where cos (blah) = 1 wait isnt it just 0 seconds lol 
Michael Lu: Because pi/2 is 90 in radians, and the period = 2pi/(expression) the thing has to be in radians 
Patrick Shen: ok its not 0 lol oh i see ok didnt know that LMAO fuck radians 
Michael Lu: yess Did u get D 
Patrick Shen: no 
Michael Lu: Use calculus or ur graphing calculator 
Patrick Shen: LUL 
Michael Lu: XD 
Patrick Shen: is max site of compression when its at the highest peak like the amplitude is at max 
Michael Lu: Yeah when cos = 1 
Patrick Shen: WTF so how is it not 0 cos 0 =1 LOL oh wait 
Michael Lu: Because it has to be compressed 
Patrick Shen: first time after ill just set it equal to 180 
Michael Lu: Yeah it starts out stretched at t=0 
Patrick Shen: find the 180 inside the paranthesis 
Michael Lu: Set equal yo pi 
Patrick Shen: ok ty ty got it

Michael Lu: Lol y are we still awake W O K E 
Patrick Shen: l o l im doing the math hw now 
Michael Lu: Itâs hard af 
Patrick Shen: and then i needa do some of the webassign and maybe start research paper oh shit 
Michael Lu: Lmao 
Patrick Shen: wtf yo i failed the last test lmao 
Michael Lu: #grinddontstop 
Patrick Shen: l o l dickson wrote on my test "at this point in ur math career u should be able to do quadratics" l o l 
Michael Lu: Oh dear 
Patrick Shen: i didnt see the plus sign in my quadratic 
Michael Lu: Savage 
Patrick Shen: so i took the zeroes LMAO i didnt fully simplify into one equation and i wrote (4-x)^2 = 4-x^2 its l i t kms looks like im getting a C this quarter lmfao 
Michael Lu: Maybe heâll bonus boost us ððð 
Patrick Shen: yeah no dude i wasnt even in class for integration by parts so idk whats going on 
Michael Lu: Oh lol go get some online vids 
Patrick Shen: ugh 
Michael Lu: Yah integration by parts Like Really sucks Itâs the worst 
Patrick Shen: ugh fuck is it just simply finding the v, dv u and du 
Michael Lu: Yo 
Patrick Shen: and knowing which one to pick for the u and then plugging into the formula like how does it get hard 
Michael Lu: Fuq that formula 
Patrick Shen: wat wait why does it get hard tho nah just use u and v to replace that shit lul cleans it up 
Michael Lu: Because the hw problems require a lot of algebraic manipulation 
Patrick Shen: what do u mean by algebraic manipulation 
Michael Lu: Like integrating by parts Puts u in a loop 
Patrick Shen: uhhh yes 
Michael Lu: Where you never get rid of the integral 
Patrick Shen: oh 
Michael Lu: So you have to rearrange a bunch of stuff cheekily 
Patrick Shen: so u gotta do like u sub and other stuff 
Michael Lu: To get the answer Itâs usually algebraic black magic 
Patrick Shen: can u do u sub in a integration by parts like 
Michael Lu: Not usually 
Patrick Shen: true 
Michael Lu: Like u can, but idk if it often helps 
Patrick Shen: i dont think it makes sense to do it really yeah it wont okie yo litty do u mind hitting me up with webassign questions 12 and 13 lol i didnt do the webass and i at least want the mc points ty ily wat what about the last one 
Michael Lu: 14? 
Patrick Shen: 13

Michael Lu: Yassssss 
Patrick Shen: now im stuck BOI like wtf do i do 
Michael Lu: Cut out prepositional phrases 
Patrick Shen: if i cut it down any more i lose anayzation it becomes so shit imma just keep it in l o l fuck the 8 page limit

Michael Lu: V = sqrt(x - 1) Yes if u do u suv 
Patrick Shen: for liate 
Michael Lu: U sub Actually no itâs not 
Patrick Shen: its not? whats the def of a polynomial do they have to be whole number power 
Michael Lu: For LIATE, you want your polynomial and u function to be a polynomial that goes to zero as you keep on differentiating it Sqrt(x - 1) doesnât go to 0 
Patrick Shen: oh ok ty ty im so scared for this test lol 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Patrick Shen: btw ur story is hilarious but its + or - C ur wrong make sure to be always prepared 
Michael Lu: U goon XD 
Patrick Shen: ur the real goon one more thing if its (x+4)-2 u should just do usub right (X+ 4)^-2 i meant like u cant do power right 
Michael Lu: Wdym u canât do power 
Patrick Shen: like u cant do power rule right add one and then divide by new power 
Michael Lu: Yeah you can do power rule with u sub 
Patrick Shen: yeah i mean u cant just straight up do power cuz the inside has stuff in there its not just like x 
Michael Lu: Not rlly yah 
Patrick Shen: wait so am i right lol 
Michael Lu: It just so happens youâd probably get the right answer this time 
Patrick Shen: yeah true aight imma do u sub just to be safe 
Michael Lu: Or you could foil it Lol 
Patrick Shen: hell no what would that do lool how does that help 
Michael Lu: Idk

Patrick Shen: did u do the webassign 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Patrick Shen: ok wait nvm lol 


Conversation:
Patrick Shen: hey litty I have a question its concept why are we allowed to use components of distance like even tho the actual distance isnt perpendicular, doesnt the distance have to be from the pivot to the point where the force is exerted if u use component of the distance, it doesnt go from pivot to force exertion point anymore right? yuhan said something about cross product 
Michael Lu: Use the dashed line for distance It doesnât go through the pivot 
Patrick Shen: yeah thats what im saying 
Michael Lu: But itâs perpendicular to force, thatâs what matters 
Patrick Shen: i guess yeah yuhan was like its some cross product thing u can still use it even tho it doesnt go thru pivot 
Michael Lu: Yeah Cross product I think thatâs for like the actual direction of torque Donât worry about that I guess 
Patrick Shen: yeah okie how do u do 15 LOL can i see ur fbd 
Michael Lu: I donât draw fbd 
Patrick Shen: oh well how did u do 15a isnt it just ur torque of the Ft 
Michael Lu: Hold up lemme help Andy 
Patrick Shen: equals to the torque of the rod mass and solve for force of Ft ok 
Michael Lu: Torque of tension - torque of rod mass Yeah You got it 
Patrick Shen: WTF WHAT DID I DO WRONG what was the distance for the rod mass 0.378? o well we prob have different numbers did u do tan(angle) = x/ d] and solve for x and then u used that for the distance of the rod mass 
Michael Lu: Distance is radius/2 multiplied by cos(angle) 
Patrick Shen: wait wtf 
Michael Lu: Did you already complete the webass 
Patrick Shen: what no im on 15 
Michael Lu: How many tries 
Patrick Shen: 7 
Michael Lu: Ft * h - m * g * 0.5 * r * cos(angle) = 0 Lemme draw an fbd 
Patrick Shen: where did u get cos angle from maybe i drew my tension wrong oh wait i see u cant use the rope length right u have to to make a perp distance 
Michael Lu: No because thatâs not perp to force Yeah 
Patrick Shen: of half the beam wait i mean it is perp to the force its just not the right thing to use 
Michael Lu: What 
Patrick Shen: the distance is lower lmao in ur diagram the two T's are they not perp they are its just that u dont use the rope length for distance cuz its not right lol ur supposed to find component of half beam 
Michael Lu: Distances to use are in purple Yeah Component of half the beam 
Patrick Shen: okie also how do u know Ft is going that way and not the other way lol 
Michael Lu: Well If no rope The thing swings downward clockwise right So the rope has to pull leftward counterclockwise to keep the thing stable 
Patrick Shen: Isn't it wrong tho cuz ur d will come out negative lmfao Like ur weight of beam goes clockwise So it's meh And the Torque of the tension is going positive in ur case lmao Shouldn't the tension be the other way So the equation works out 
Michael Lu: Clockwise = negative 
Patrick Shen: Yeah 
Michael Lu: Counter = positive 
Patrick Shen: So ur rod mass Is negative 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Patrick Shen: Ur tension is positive 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Patrick Shen: Tf OH WAIT I SEE shit Nvm got it 
Michael Lu: Yas patty ððð 
Patrick Shen: also the question is a bit faulty tho lmfao u drew ur mass of rod from the top of the beam so that the angles can be subtracted 
Michael Lu: what? 
Patrick Shen: cos(angle) 
Michael Lu: Idek Wdym 
Patrick Shen: u figure out the angle by doing 90- 34 or whatever angle they gave u right 
Michael Lu: No you just do 34 right 
Patrick Shen: o u do? 
Michael Lu: Isnât the angle measured above horizontal 
Patrick Shen: wait a minute did i draw my 34 wrong where is the 34 LOL idek what that means oh shitt is it below the beam 
Michael Lu: Yeah between beam and horizontal Right 
Patrick Shen: oh well then yeah ok that works then i drew my angle in the wrong place LEL i put it between the wall and the beam 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Patrick Shen: lmaoo 
Michael Lu: Is the quiz just on torque static 
Patrick Shen: yes 
Michael Lu: So just that one ppt 
Patrick Shen: yup 
Michael Lu: Aight cool 
Patrick Shen: yep thanks bro wtf no way 
Michael Lu: Nah Bro deadass Tru 
Patrick Shen: wtf holyhsit did u do it 
Michael Lu: No 
Patrick Shen: why wud he do this to us 
Michael Lu: Saving it for last

Patrick Shen: yo yeeeeee A 18.7 kg child sits on a 6.0 m long teeter-totter at a point 1.5 m from the pivot point (at the center of the teeter-totter). On the other side of the pivot point, an adult pushes straight down on the teeter-totter with a force of 195 N. Determine the direction the teeter-totter will rotate if the adult applies the force at a distance of each of the following from the pivot. (Assume the teeter-totter is horizontal when the adult applies the force and that the child's weight applies a clockwise torque.) 1 2 and 3 m

Patrick Shen: lul guessed the 50-50 
Michael Lu: Aight thx 
Patrick Shen: Mhm is #7 just Tnet= Fnet times r 
Michael Lu: wher Tnet = Ia? 
Patrick Shen: is it? o i think it is thanks 
Michael Lu: yo 3f not hollow ball send pic when u done pls man help a bro out 
Patrick Shen: lol what do u want me to try 
Michael Lu: all travel same or box idk guess 
Patrick Shen: all travel same is correct YO IM GETTING THESE 50-50's ITS LIT 
Michael Lu: yas send pic so we make sure its same question lol thx pat ur the god ð 
Patrick Shen: np 
Michael Lu: lol pat #8 
Patrick Shen: lol 
Michael Lu: MC it's not same time 
Patrick Shen: its not cylinder 2 LOL so its either 1 or need to know the radius 
Michael Lu: lol guessing could only get u so far 
Patrick Shen: yeah lmfao 
Michael Lu: aight hold tight asking somebody else 
Patrick Shen: okie 
Michael Lu: Cylinder 1 lol 
Patrick Shen: RIP 
Michael Lu: 10 it's not more info im guessing same idk fml fuq webass 
Patrick Shen: Since when have u had so much trouble With this 
Michael Lu: too lazy to think out the concept questions 
Patrick Shen: Wdym same Like equal to zero Or non zero 
Michael Lu: idk guess pat 
Patrick Shen: ok welp its not equal and nonzero how tf do u do number 8 
Michael Lu: #10 ring > disk 
Patrick Shen: whats the equation setup for 8 and thanks 
Michael Lu: after a high-stakes heist involving 6 ppl 
Patrick Shen: LOLOLOLOL 
Michael Lu: hold up for Q 8 you're after kimbo solve for a alpha* 
Patrick Shen: im asking with kimbo we are doing it together lol 
Michael Lu: Torque (from just the rope force) = I (for disk) * alpha 
Patrick Shen: oh shit i meant 13 LOL not 8 
Michael Lu: oh fuq is that the yo yo oh lol same as kimbos 
Patrick Shen: yeah holy shit are these questions that bad fuck 
Michael Lu: Tgrav = Ia 
Patrick Shen: imma legit fail this unit tf but u dont have mass or the angular and what is Tgrav 
Michael Lu: mass cancels Torque of gravity on the beam Fg * r * cos(theta) gravity times perpendicular radius component 
Patrick Shen: ohhhhh i see ok thank youu is that the only equation we need for this webass Tnet= Ia like what else do we need T= Fr thats it 
Michael Lu: i think so 
Patrick Shen: okie Wanna send me the mc So I don't die at night Trying to do them help a pal out godlike how do u do 3 is density = I 
Michael Lu: Density is m/v 
Patrick Shen: I didn't even finish the webass LOL I was up until 3 Last night 
Michael Lu: XD 
Patrick Shen: Kms 3 questions left All pulley Oh for 13 The weird one My numbers aren't working out like I was so frustrated last night I threw a book at my wall LMAO I'm on try number 8 I used ur equation and everything I even checked yahoo answers 
Michael Lu: XD 
Patrick Shen: Wanna help Imma have a cow if I don't figure this out 
Michael Lu: What question Iâll try my best not at home rn 
Patrick Shen: 13 
Michael Lu: Is this the yo-yo 
Patrick Shen: No The angle The one where gravity does the torque 
Michael Lu: Boi didnât I say Kimberly figured it out You* 
Patrick Shen: Yeah And I did it ur way didn't work 8 times I did it 
Michael Lu: Send a pic of the prob 
Patrick Shen: Ok gimme a sec 
Michael Lu: r/2 * cos(angle) * 9.8 * m = (1/3) * m * r^2 * alpha 
Patrick Shen: Yea I did that Didn't work Wait Isn't it R/2 squared On the right side Cuz it's 1/3 l^2 Times m 
Michael Lu: 7.71 Did u try 
Patrick Shen: QTF HELLO No I never got that How did u do it 
Michael Lu: Do it first 
Patrick Shen: That's right Wtf Do I know how to divide OH WAIT why is it 1.3 squared And not 1.3/2 squared 
Michael Lu: Because ur moving entire beam For moment of inertial 
Patrick Shen: OH WHAT THE FUCK HELLO 
Michael Lu: The entire 1.3 m 
Patrick Shen: I've been dividing it by 2 The whole time 
Michael Lu: But the torque only acts in the center 
Patrick Shen: FUCK 
Michael Lu: Aight gtg 
Patrick Shen: Ok Thanks lol I'm so mad 
Michael Lu: XD np 
Patrick Shen: how do u do 14 lol i just started doing the webass ok i finished all except 16 now how the fuck do u do the yo-yo question plz enlighten me what are the three equations does he really expect us to do that its so fucking hard Send work plz Ty ily How tf do u get that Lmaoooo 
Michael Lu: 5r and 6r might change for u 
Patrick Shen: Why 
Michael Lu: You have different numbers for how different the radius is The equations come from torque calculations based on diff pivots 
Patrick Shen: Mine is 4.75 What is my Myo Oh mass of yo yo ok I think I get t It I just use 1 and 4.75 for my r Instead of 5 and 6 
Michael Lu: Not rlly 
Patrick Shen: Wat Why not 
Michael Lu: Hold on 6 -> 4.75 5 -> 3.75 
Patrick Shen: Tf How did u get that 
Michael Lu: This image was for Jon Wong 
Patrick Shen: Yeah but why is it 3.75 and not 1 I have to do Susie's webassign so I needa know why the radius is like that anyways lmao 
Michael Lu: T1 is directed outside gray circle (radius = r) Which means itâs 3.75r from edge of yo-yo 4.75r - r 
Patrick Shen: What the fuck Sorry I don't really get it lmao 
Michael Lu: Okay the pivot is the edge 
Patrick Shen: The pink one yes 
Michael Lu: Tgrav is at center 
Patrick Shen: Yes 
Michael Lu: Which is 4.75r away from edge 
Patrick Shen: Yes 
Michael Lu: Now T1 is one r away from center 
Patrick Shen: Yes 
Michael Lu: So itâs closer to the edge/pivot by 1r 
Patrick Shen: Oh I get it ok thanks Ayyyy u did it U taught me lmfao Ty litty 
Michael Lu: Yeah so all the coefficients for r are diff for u and Susie 
Patrick Shen: Mhm got it how do u get 17 
Michael Lu: Send a pic 
Patrick Shen: What's the concept How did u get that 
Michael Lu: Tnet = I * alpha Alpha = a/r Tnet = F1r - F2r 
Patrick Shen: o got it okie didnt understand the alpha part but nw i got it ty 
Michael Lu: Np

Patrick Shen: what exactly does angular dynamics mean LOL moving? like angular static means nothing is moving 
Michael Lu: Yeah... I think so 
Patrick Shen: ugh ok 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: What did yâall do in BC today 
Patrick Shen: 1 question Washer literally 1 question LOL 
Michael Lu: Deadass? 
Patrick Shen: yes 
Michael Lu: Why was it hard? 
Patrick Shen: Radius is diff no longer f(x) It's like rotate around x=2 now instead of x axis That's all we learned also the physics quiz was hard lol I got the whole back wrong Maybe it's cuz I suck at pulleys 
Michael Lu: Lol cool thing I skipped 
Patrick Shen: the Atwood pulley Fuck that shit 
Michael Lu: XD Webassign help? Help pat 
Patrick Shen: LUL 
Michael Lu: Cmon man help 
Patrick Shen: I'm not home uhhhhh 
Michael Lu: Your phone? 
Patrick Shen: And my phone is aboutta die no battery lmao 
Michael Lu: Fuqqqq 
Patrick Shen: It's legit on 2% Ok i gotta go Sorry Later tonight 
Michael Lu: Patttttttt 
Patrick Shen: Yeah I'm here I'm getting on webass lol Both of them? 
Michael Lu: 14 Try less 
Patrick Shen: Ok U don't need 10? 
Michael Lu: No I got another fam 
Patrick Shen: What's the answer To that 
Michael Lu: Thx man 
Patrick Shen: Np yo litty if they give u vi= 20 m/s and it says ball rolls up hill do we assume that the start has no rotational KE only translational? question didnt give any angular speed value 
Michael Lu: What questions 
Patrick Shen: 3 
Michael Lu: Send a pic pls? I think assume no rotational? 
Patrick Shen: Ok We do cuz if they don't give an angular speed right 
Michael Lu: It starts with all trans KE 
Patrick Shen: okie ty 
Michael Lu: Lmk if u need me to check my webass 
Patrick Shen: how do u do 3a LOL why did i get it wrong 
Michael Lu: Thereâs no trans Ke At the end 
Patrick Shen: wtf but its rolling 
Michael Lu: Thereâs no trans 
Patrick Shen: OH i see its still spinnin after it reaches max point right it just wont go any higher idk i forgot he said something like that in class 
Michael Lu: Idk Wait hold on 
Patrick Shen: yeah it says in our notes idk why tho how do u know its only rotational KE left like why not translational or none at all 
Michael Lu: Itâs only Ug left 
Patrick Shen: wat 
Michael Lu: When u roll a ball up a hill Itâs max height is when it stops moving and rolling 
Patrick Shen: yeah 
Michael Lu: Wait I think there is rotational at the beginning 
Patrick Shen: so whats with the A and B tf how are we supposed to know 
Michael Lu: It says in the question It started spinning 
Patrick Shen: o ok so it starts with Ke rot and trans and ends with just mgh but like is that cuz it has friction so it will reach the max height or something like the notes says frictionless vs friction is different cases for max height there are different energies 
Michael Lu: So frictionless goes lower That u just do straight energy conservation 
Patrick Shen: wdym why does frictionless go lower 
Michael Lu: Both situations have same speed But the friction one is also rolling So it has more energy to start with 
Patrick Shen: oh wait i think i get it wait does frictionless vs friction have one going higher oh wait yeah that makes sense nvm i got it 
Michael Lu: Friction goes higher 
Patrick Shen: ohhh yeah cuz there is more mgh all ke converted got it ok ty y do they all travel same distnace for 3f nvm i got it how do u do 4a LOL isnt it just I = 1/12 m l^2 
Michael Lu: Lol Is it MC? Send a pic Canât access the questions on my phone need flash Find I for rod 
Patrick Shen: Is it through center 
Michael Lu: Add to I for two balls (point mass) 
Patrick Shen: Isn't the I for the two balls 0 Cuz radius is 0 
Michael Lu: No 
Patrick Shen: Tf 
Michael Lu: Radius is midpoint of rod 
Patrick Shen: OH SHIT WTF I did full length Uh jk it's still wrong wait what Wait so do u make three I equations also its not radius btw its length 
Michael Lu: The radius of the ball for I is from ball center to center of rod 
Patrick Shen: Etc Wtf Why 
Michael Lu: Imagine half the rod as a string connecting a pivot to the ball 
Patrick Shen: OH wtf Why isn't it just the ball LMAO . That's stupid ok so I do need to make three I equations 
Michael Lu: Yeah kinda I guess Three I and add me up 
Patrick Shen: what the fuck im gonna like murder this question How is this wrong 
Michael Lu: Theyâre point masses 
Patrick Shen: Yeah 
Michael Lu: The pivot for the balls is not inside the ball 
Patrick Shen: Idk wtf that means 
Michael Lu: So you have a sphere 
Patrick Shen: Solid sphere 
Michael Lu: But depending on the location of the pivot The I changed Itâs just mr^2 
Patrick Shen: Uhhh yeah oh But mr^2 is for cylinder Or hoop So everything is same just change it to mr^2 for mass 2 and 1 
Michael Lu: Yeah mr^2 + mr^2 + 1/12 * mr^2 I believe 
Patrick Shen: Thank you god I don't get why it's mr^2 But ok 
Michael Lu: Itâs a point mass When the pivot is outside the object 
Patrick Shen: yeah i saw Once again Number 5 I can't tell Is it only KE rotational At the bottom of ramp OH WAIT IS SLIPPING NOT SAME AS SLIDING holy fuck Is slipping for friction OMG I get it I'm a god 
Michael Lu: Yass pat 
Patrick Shen: can u explain 8 and 10 LOL i dont get them 
Michael Lu: Send pic Oh lol tbh I really donât know I can only guess 
Patrick Shen: LMAO okie imma just ask him wells on monday did u do the calc hw 
Michael Lu: Yeah which one 
Patrick Shen: 4 and 20 u know how u gotta convert it by isolatng x if u have x=2 how do u turn that into f(y) lol 
Michael Lu: Yeah solve for x 
Patrick Shen: wat 
Michael Lu: And then get x = bunch of crap with y 
Patrick Shen: but there is no y its x=2 
Michael Lu: Okay then itâs x = 2 Put 2 into integrated Integrand* 
Patrick Shen: tf wdym send pic of work? if u dont mind 
Michael Lu: What number 
Patrick Shen: 4 and 20 Ty 
Michael Lu: Np Hopefully itâs right 
Patrick Shen: Ummm I'm confused LOL imma just ask Dickson for help on this 
Michael Lu: Integrate horizontal cross sections Which means integrating x = crap with respect to y 
Patrick Shen: but like for 3 4 the two functions is x=2 and y= 1.x right 1/x 
Michael Lu: okay so you already have one x= Which is x = 2 
Patrick Shen: but its rotating around y axis which means its a vertical cross section so i found the domain 0 to 2 
Michael Lu: When I rotate around y axis The disks 
Patrick Shen: ye] its vertical the disks are vertical 
Michael Lu: Arenât the circles horizontal 
Patrick Shen: oh wait jk yeah its horizontal anyways so ur integrating from 0 to 2 right and its horizontal disks so that means its right minus left 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Patrick Shen: so isnt that in terms of dy so u gotta change everything to make it x= something 
Michael Lu: And since y = 1/x, x = 1/y Yeah 
Patrick Shen: ok got that and what about the other one isnt the other function x=2 
Michael Lu: x = 2, x = 1/y 
Patrick Shen: oh shit OH 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Patrick Shen: wait but ohhh wtf thats not what u wrote tho its this 
Michael Lu: Oh fuq Sent the wrong hw 
Patrick Shen: LMAO I got so confused ok 
Michael Lu: Mah b Trying to multitask rn 
Patrick Shen: It's ok Send real one? Lol 
Michael Lu: Yo wtf which hw is this 
Patrick Shen: last one due tuesday washers 
Michael Lu: Fuq Yo just trust my words 
Patrick Shen: LMAO i do i just wanna check my answer 
Michael Lu: Integral(2 - 1/y) dy | 1/2 < y < 2 ;) 
Patrick Shen: lol ok 
Michael Lu: I think thatâs I It 
Patrick Shen: oh wait 
Michael Lu: Wait 
Patrick Shen: nvm thats right its 1/2 to 2 
Michael Lu: With the radius formula and pi and crap Ur work looks right 
Patrick Shen: yeeeee 
Michael Lu: Do u have math notes? Thx 
Patrick Shen: lol ill send it to u tom morning im nowhere near my table 
Michael Lu: Thx m8 Were there any theorems Or just examples? 
Patrick Shen: just examples 
Michael Lu: Fuq Ok 
Patrick Shen: yeah... did u get the theorem for washers? idk if u were there lol like we did do theorems, but not on fridy 
Michael Lu: Yeah I think I did

Michael Lu: Yo Perry Did u apply to West Point? 
Perry Choo: Yeah but I'm gunning way more for naval Tello and I are both waiting on an official acceptance rn 
Michael Lu: Which is harder to get into? 
Perry Choo: Probably West point bc there's a lot more applicants from our district and NY who want to go there Than any other acadeny Academy* 
Michael Lu: But in terms of the application process and physical test? 
Perry Choo: Almost the same stuff West Point asks for a physics or chem teacher rec in addition to everything else  that naval wants 
Michael Lu: Do you need like a rec from a congressman? Also, how do they weight academics, extracurricular, and the physical exam? 
Perry Choo: Yeah u need to go for a nomination interview with at least one of three sources I'm going for my last one today but I don't really need to lol 
Michael Lu: Lol u got multiple? 
Perry Choo: I got 1 nomination rn which is all u need 
Michael Lu: Dammmm 
Perry Choo: But I interview Al 4 3* Are u def sure u wanna go tho BTW admissions looks are u holistically At* 
Michael Lu: No Iâm just asking 
Perry Choo: Alright 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Yo What branch of the military you going into? Navy or Marines? 
Perry Choo: Right now everyone at the academy were in the navy But once we commision, roughly 250 of the 1100 of us commission into the marines 
Michael Lu: Everyone becomes an officer right? 
Perry Choo: Yeah What's up 
Michael Lu: Lol just wondering 
Perry Choo: Ok lol 
Michael Lu: U thinking marines or navy Do u get to choose? 
Perry Choo: Yeah I do get to choose I'm pretty set on marines But theres a 50/50 chance I wanna fly for the marines instead of ground forces 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: How long do u serve? 4 years? 
Perry Choo: 5 after I graduate Unless I go pilot, which is 7 years after graduation and flight school 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Wait do officers get to choose their MOS (lol is that what itâs called)? 
Perry Choo: So it works a little differently than enlisted For the most part, almost everyone gets their first warfare community choice (surface, submarines, marines, pilots, etc) And I know in the marines, not many get their first MOS choice (infantry, logistics, etc) But usually get an MOS in their top 5 
Michael Lu: Is this specifically for officers, naval academy grads, or in general? 
Perry Choo: I can speak for naval academy grads I cant really speak for ROTX ROTC* On the other side, in flight school, your platform (FA-18, helicopters, etc) is also very much flight school performance dependant 
Michael Lu: Lol what if itâs MIT ROTC idk does that help Well Iâm not doing flight prob lol 
Perry Choo: My cyber professor did MIT ROTC He flew P-3s 
Michael Lu: Cyber for navy? 
Perry Choo: Yeah 
Michael Lu: Dope Cyber for marines doesnât exist tho right

Rachel Kosofsky: Hey for the lab did u get a density of below 1 for our data?? 
Michael Lu: Above 1 for part 1 Below 1 fir the second part lol 1.16 and 0.86 I think XD 
Rachel Kosofsky: Ok thatâs what I got too but our hot dog sunk so it doesnât make sense right? 
Michael Lu: Yeah idj Idk It âsunkâ 
Rachel Kosofsky: Lol ok

Raj Movva: hey michael - great to have you on the floor! remind me, were you interested at all in potentially rushing a frat 
Michael Lu: Yeah def 
Raj Movva: solid dude, come thru to the ZBT rush events tomorrow so you can meet more bros and have a good time 


Conversation:
Raj Movva: hey michael, sorry i missed you today, but we'd love to have you spend more time at our events and meet more of us. tomorrow, we have a breakfast from 9am-11am, paintball from 12pm-4pm, dinner at the house (salmon) from 5:30-7:30pm, and then bowling and IHOP from 8pm-12am. i'd especially recommend bowling and IHOP if possible, its one of our signature events and a great time to have some good conversations with brothers. it was my favorite event of rush last year and the reason i joined ZBT, when i was pretty on the fence between ZBT and a couple similar frats

Reid Fleishman: RIP BJDâs website 
Michael Lu: Oh no :( 
Reid Fleishman: I can just picture him so angry when he finds out and the first thing heâll say is âShenanigansâ 
Michael Lu: Urright XD 
Reid Fleishman: did anyone respond to the thing about him that u posted in that chat that article 
Michael Lu: Yea 
Reid Fleishman: what did they say ð 


Conversation:
Reid Fleishman: I hear the amazing voice of Barry 
Michael Lu: Yes yes yes 


Conversation:
Reid Fleishman: R u gonna teach us how to use the new solidworks cad on Tuesday or r we sticking with inventor 
Michael Lu: Likely sikidwords Solidworks Bring a laptop if possible btw Iâll discuss how the switch is  going to work But of course it depends on how many people show up 
Reid Fleishman: can the laptop be a mac? 
Michael Lu: If u have windows on it Yeah XD 
Reid Fleishman: lol ok ill install windows on in. I mean canât we use the school comps 
Michael Lu: Not this year We donât have the license 
Reid Fleishman: oh i see do we need to download anything before we go to school?  bc thereâs no wifi for personal devices in school 
Michael Lu: Ummmmm good point Okay so I might as well do this now Go to solidworksâ website 
Reid Fleishman: unless we go to the library bc theres student wife there 
Michael Lu: And create an account and try to download the 60 day trial Whenever, Tuesday today 
Reid Fleishman: ok btw lets not use my file management solution on tuesday, just to make things simple 
Michael Lu: Yep 
Reid Fleishman: what do i put for company i just put GNSHS anyway when I launch the free trial it opens like a virtual windows machine in the web browser.  it doesnât actually download anything 
Michael Lu: 60 day trial should be a download Did u create an account? 
Reid Fleishman: yes 
Michael Lu: How to But -> Request a Demo 
Reid Fleishman: I just did that but it says that a sales representative will contact me 
Michael Lu: Whoops Go to products -> 3D CAD Sorry about that Do you see the try now Wait nvm Hold on let me get the packet 
Reid Fleishman: lol ok ah ok u should probably post that on the robotics facebook and tell ppl to download it before coming to the cad meeting 
Michael Lu: No ur the guinea pig right now XD sry I need to know if it works On multiple devices first 
Reid Fleishman: ok 
Michael Lu: I think thatâs it Itâs a long download tho 
Reid Fleishman: which one 
Michael Lu: I think I went with individual 
Reid Fleishman: ok and which serial # do i put 
Michael Lu: Was it emailed to you? 
Reid Fleishman: yes there are like so many different ones so do i do all 
Michael Lu: Yep 
Reid Fleishman: ugh 
Michael Lu: The email you received Should give the codes for which ones you can download I have these installed Might be one more idk just look at the email Enter codes then submit 
Reid Fleishman: ok 
Michael Lu: If something is wrong the download exe will tell u 
Reid Fleishman: ok downloading now 
Michael Lu: Yay 
Reid Fleishman: only 356 minutes to go (slow wifi, macbook doesnât have ethernet port) 
Michael Lu: Haha XD Youll get there 
Reid Fleishman: now it says 202 minutes all the sudden lol so it liked the codes which means u can prob let other ppl download it 
Michael Lu: Thatâs good Hopefully it also means I can create a new trial account 
Reid Fleishman: maybe can we get the school to buy us a linh send license 
Michael Lu: Itâs probably gonna be done next year 
Reid Fleishman: so does that mean we can use sw next year?  bc it depends if next year means before or after build season I think u should post these instructions on Facebook so ppl can download it before the meeting tomorrow now that we know multiple ppl can use it 
Michael Lu: Iâd prefer that ppl who come to the meeting download it TBH Iâd rather not have too many people downloading solid works/getting intimidated Unless they come to the meeting 
Reid Fleishman: Yeah, But remember thereâs no internet there for ppl to download it, so isnât the point of the meeting to teach ppl how to use it 
Michael Lu: They donât need to download it at the meeting Iâm not teaching them at the meeting 
Reid Fleishman: Ohhhh ok Didnât realize that 
Michael Lu: Lol itâs ok 
Reid Fleishman: What do I do here Should I just do internet 


Conversation:
Reid Fleishman: What are we doing with this 
Michael Lu: Hold on Iâll explain soon Setting up a lot of things rn 
Reid Fleishman: Ok How many polls r there I only see 2 
Michael Lu: I think messenger only allows one poll at once 


Conversation:
Reid Fleishman: So as I may have noticed in the group chat I am away at camp starting tomorrow until August 10th.  I cannot bring any devices there so I cannot work in CAD.  So would you be able to leave all the assignments I missed up on drive and Iâll do them when I get back? U* 
Michael Lu: Yeah ok 


Conversation:
Reid Fleishman: Iâm back now so I will try to complete all the assignments within the next few days Uh oh My subscription expired so what should I do 
Michael Lu: Yeah... Same Can you try creating a new sw account With a Different email Then try to redownload the trial? 
Reid Fleishman: I tried a different email and it didnt work so I reinstalled windows and then reinstalled solid works and it worked 
Michael Lu: Oh Okay haha 
Reid Fleishman: Just a quick question.  How do u trim a part in an assemble.  For example If I wanted to trim this stock down to where my mouse pointer is how would I do that? 
Michael Lu: Use split Make a plabr Plane 
Reid Fleishman: I cannot figure out how to get to the split It seems like u can only use split when ur in a part itself 
Michael Lu: Not at home rn so I canât be sure Open up the part then split 
Reid Fleishman: Ok so Iâll make a duplicate and then split How would I drill a hole in this stock to put in a bearing 
Michael Lu: In that flat stock? Idk if that would work in real life But regardless, Make an extruded cut 
Reid Fleishman: Itâs a 1in stock 
Michael Lu: Oh lol 
Reid Fleishman: So I would have to edit the individual part again? 
Michael Lu: Yeah Itâs like that in Inventor too 
Reid Fleishman: Oh Thereâs gotta be a better way to do that But whatever lol 


Conversation:
Reid Fleishman: Iâm sorry Iâm still confused.  When I open up the Assembly that I downloaded it seems like all the parts are already assembled. 
Michael Lu: Pull them apart Theyâre not constrained 
Reid Fleishman: Ah I see.  So I just mate those together and thatâs it? 
Michael Lu: Yep So you can see how to put things together. 
Reid Fleishman: Cool. 


Conversation:
Reid Fleishman: have u tried doing this yet? 
Michael Lu: Yes Corrigan got the reply email and directions 
Reid Fleishman: so weâre able to get it for free but the school is not letting us install on the computers? 
Michael Lu: I believe so Also Corrigan got a response for a 60 day trial So weâre not sure exactly what the deal is If you could get the reply document from Corrigan youâll have a better idea 
Reid Fleishman: oh ok.  i can talk to corrigan about it.  Saif is also looking into it 
Michael Lu: Cool thanks If itâs not possible itâs fine 
Reid Fleishman: all i care about is that i can use my skills in solid words in inventor too without much re-learning solid works 
Michael Lu: Theyâre definitely translatable Donât worry 
Reid Fleishman: alright bye 


Conversation:
Reid Fleishman: I just got an email back from the solidworks ppl who I emailed last week.  I will go ahead and email them back to see if we can get solidworks. 
Michael Lu: Okay, go for it! 


Conversation:
Reid Fleishman: This week we r running sessions on each specific interest group each day, so could u run a cad informational session on thrursday?  It will only be till 3:30 at the latest 
Michael Lu: I think so Iâll confirm this week 
Reid Fleishman: Ok 


Conversation:
Reid Fleishman: U should be back at CAD ð 
Michael Lu: Haha Iâll be back next week more 


Conversation:
Reid Fleishman: U coming  today? 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Is robotics open rn 
Reid Fleishman: Iâm not there idk 


Conversation:
Reid Fleishman: Congrats on MIT that is amazing 
Michael Lu: Lol wat 
Reid Fleishman: Donât deny it lol 
Michael Lu: Who is spreading this information 
Reid Fleishman: Donât worry about it ð Actually Iâll tell u Motch told me to put this on the website 
Michael Lu: Oh lol Yeah maybe donât If u must :( 
Reid Fleishman: When he told me a few weeks ago I said no but then today heâs like where is it so I canât rly not listen to him 
Michael Lu: Alright go ahead... itâs a huge oof to me tho Not blaming u But lol Big oof 
Reid Fleishman: Lol Iâll put it between reveal and finger lakes So it wonât be on top 
Michael Lu: Well 
Reid Fleishman: What was the exact date u found out 
Michael Lu: MIT and Val came out 3/14 Oh the same day Actually Then I went on to fight a bedroom fire at night lol 
Reid Fleishman: Lol 
Michael Lu: 3/14 
Reid Fleishman: What a day MIT Val Fire 
Michael Lu: Both on pi day Yup 
Reid Fleishman: And that too 
Michael Lu: Yah I think you can put it under finge flakes 
Reid Fleishman: Also what was that duel today 
Michael Lu: Very fun 
Reid Fleishman: What happens Ed* 
Michael Lu: Zizic me and Neves Poked holes in bottles And squirts each other 
Reid Fleishman: Lol But seriously u should be proud of MIT, I donât know much about colleges but I know enough to know that itâs super hard to get into 
Michael Lu: Lol thx Reid !! 
Reid Fleishman: It was all from CAD 
Michael Lu: Haha sure XD 


Conversation:
Reid Fleishman: Just curious how possible do u think it is to try to get the school to upgrade to inventor 2020 Itâs still free for educational use 
Michael Lu: Could be but Iâd imagine getting on all school computers will take a while If you bring it up early enough, you could get it before summer? if not before winter 
Reid Fleishman: Ok Iâll talk to Motch about it when we get back from break 


Conversation:
Reid Fleishman: Oh is that a ð I see 
Michael Lu: ð 


Conversation:
Reid Fleishman: Where u at? 
Michael Lu: Left 
Reid Fleishman: Can I talk to u for a sec 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Reid Fleishman: Ok So r u gonna make like tutorial videos? For CAD 
Michael Lu: I donât have software to edit But I can plan with yâall a video series I think we should talk tmrw 
Reid Fleishman: Well u can just like do the teaching and talking and I can edit it But ok yeah letâs talk tomorrow 


Conversation:
Reid Fleishman: Motch is leaving So can we go to library 
Michael Lu: If you guys could finish the assignment planning bullet list for tmrw You guys already have a good idea 
Reid Fleishman: Yeah we will 
Michael Lu: Of what to do 
Reid Fleishman: Were pretty much done with the rough outline If you want you can take a look at it no W Itâs in the 2019 shenanigans folder 
Michael Lu: Yeah Iâll take a look when I get home from the firehouse 


Conversation:
Reid Fleishman: Did u guys go to the leadership council webpage in the apple store 
Michael Lu: Ummm no Idk 
Reid Fleishman: I can tell someone did 
Michael Lu: Oh lol 
Reid Fleishman: Weâre u in garden city? 
Michael Lu: Nah 
Reid Fleishman: Ok nvm Just trying to see how creepy I can be 
Michael Lu: Lollll Oh interesting 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Oh boy Lakeville? Or middle school 
Reid Fleishman: 6th grade 
Michael Lu: Interesting 
Reid Fleishman: i have them of all the seniors or most of them 
Michael Lu: Oh haha Blackmail I see 
Reid Fleishman: ð 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Oh boy 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Thank u sir 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Eyyy 
Reid Fleishman: Also how u doing on those cad videos 
Michael Lu: Starting it today Will try to record lesson 1 by end of the week 


Conversation:
Reid Fleishman: How you doing on the first vid 
Michael Lu: Iâve been running into a technical difficulty Where Inventor wonât startup Been trying to open for the past two days Going for a reinstall today 
Reid Fleishman: Ok Does it give an error or just doesnât open at all? 
Michael Lu: I think itâs because I had 2018 installed before It opens the loading window 
Reid Fleishman: Ah ok 
Michael Lu: But never gets past And Inventor never shows up on the task bar 
Reid Fleishman: Is 2018 uninstalled too? 
Michael Lu: Yes 
Reid Fleishman: Ok 
Michael Lu: But autodesk desktop was not 
Reid Fleishman: So i guess try to uninstall everything again So I assume no progress was made on the video 
Michael Lu: Nope Iâm trying to get it done today When I get home 
Reid Fleishman: Ok 
Michael Lu: Fire school is over So I should be able to roll out videos 
Reid Fleishman: Do a test of the recording with ur voice before the real one Just to make sure it all works with the audio and stuff 
Michael Lu: Havenât done a test but I configured OBS 
Reid Fleishman: K Record it 1080p 60 FPS if possible 
Michael Lu: Exporting as MOV files just for ur Mac Yeah I got it at 1080 60 
Reid Fleishman: K U can also just do mp4âs since I think theyâre faster and smaller Macs work with those too 
Michael Lu: Mov is higher quality tho 
Reid Fleishman: True Ok so do those then 
Michael Lu: Can I record everything in one go 
Reid Fleishman: Sure 
Michael Lu: And then u cut out some parts to make it a watchable length 
Reid Fleishman: If you mess up just redo that part in the same take and Iâll just cut out the mess up 
Michael Lu: Ok everything works Iâm recording tonight 
Reid Fleishman: Sweet When ur done just upload all the footage to the drive Tomer Folder* 
Michael Lu: Can u look at Littyâs OBS Test In the server Howâs the Audio! I donât have a great mic I can try to look for one 
Reid Fleishman: Ok let me check it Yeah the audios  fine But why is the video so laggy 
Michael Lu: Is it? It could just be Inventor 
Reid Fleishman: Yeah inventor is laggy in ur video 
Michael Lu: Oh yeah itâs rlly laggy 
Reid Fleishman: Why 
Michael Lu: Lemme look at video settings 
Reid Fleishman: Ok Maybe also check inventorâs settings Like maybe tone down graphics quality or something But you should probably make sure itâs not laggy for the actual tutorial if possible 
Michael Lu: It works better once FPS is down to 30 Lol sry my computer isnât too beefy 
Reid Fleishman: Ok then do 30 FPS Do another test then put that on server for me to see 
Michael Lu: K itâs in there 2019-06-30 
Reid Fleishman: Much better But also do u notice how it like doesnât fill the whole screen 
Michael Lu: Yah My output is set to 1920x1080 
Reid Fleishman: So I assume ur monitor is less than 1080p 
Michael Lu: Yeah lemme see if I can find my base resolution 
Reid Fleishman: Yeah try to find that then I guess u can output the obs to that If not itâs not the end of the world bc I can just crop the black space 
Michael Lu: Alright fixed In the server 
Reid Fleishman: Ok yeah looks much better 
Michael Lu: Iâm gonna start recording U can delete those test vids 
Reid Fleishman: I think youâre good to start So did u finish the first recording 
Michael Lu: Still working on it Abt halfway 
Reid Fleishman: Nice 
Michael Lu: It takes much longer than expected Can I move the video files to the server 
Reid Fleishman: How big are they? 
Michael Lu: For u to pick them up Lemme check A bunch of video clips Each abt 1 megabyte I can share what I have rn 
Reid Fleishman: Oh ok thatâs like nothing Then yeah just put it in a folder on the serve R I was gonna say if theyâre like over 10 GB then they will slow down the server 
Michael Lu: Only occurs with your server but not local save 
Reid Fleishman: Hmm Never seen that before Try reopening Or re-logging into the server 
Michael Lu: How do I religious in Relogin 
Reid Fleishman: Just delete the shortcut 
Michael Lu: Ok Still problems encountered 
Reid Fleishman: Ok just save locally for now 
Michael Lu: Itâs for the video tho Should I not touch upon the server at all During the series? 
Reid Fleishman: Ok hold on with that Record something else Iâll take a look when I get home in a few hours 
Michael Lu: Iâll just do a local save in the tutorial for now 
Reid Fleishman: Did u try restarting onvenot Inventor How bout this save it locally then transfer it to the server Then open it on the server and try saving it That should work 
Michael Lu: Well The point is to save it the first time On the server in the video Iâll just do it locally for now 
Reid Fleishman: Ok 
Michael Lu: Ok Iâm moving thr lesson 1 video to the server Find it under my LEADERS folder for Litty Ling 40 MB total The first clip is 1intro Then just go by abc order Such as 1b1 -> 1b2 -> 1c1 -> 1c2.... You might have to cut out some slip ups to make the video cohesive Lmk if u need anything Fixed Another team wants to join our program 
Reid Fleishman: Ok just got home Iâm gonna start putting the footage together Which team is that? 
Michael Lu: 2874 2875* Idk Their mentor emailed me Maybe we can give access to tutorials in a separate GC? As well as assignments But ur not rlly obligated to grade the Or provide server access But sharing with them would give a huge PR boost for awards 
Reid Fleishman: Yeah they canât get server access 
Michael Lu: Thatâs fine 
Reid Fleishman: But yeah that would be cool We can share the videos with them 
Michael Lu: Iâm thinking make some sort of group with just them 
Reid Fleishman: We can put them on our website or something 
Michael Lu: And just share tutorials and assignments Yeah The only thing is just the parts library 
Reid Fleishman: We can zip it and 
Michael Lu: Needs to be shared 
Reid Fleishman: Give it to them that way 
Michael Lu: Yup Can they all still use ur autodesk account to install? 
Reid Fleishman: Sure 
Michael Lu: Alrighty Iâll forward u the email 
Reid Fleishman: I was actually playing around with a website thing for cad And I made a template 
Michael Lu: Looks good! 
Reid Fleishman: Ok Iâll start populating that as well with our videos Also did u figure out that error yet Where r u trying to save it in the server 
Michael Lu: Anywhere in the server Iâll try again tonight 
Reid Fleishman: Did u try restarting inventor 
Michael Lu: Not yet 
Reid Fleishman: Try that Restarting always works Also maybe the computer too 
Michael Lu: True true 
Reid Fleishman: Ok just finished editing the video It looks very good For the saving the part, I guess just try again with the server 
Michael Lu: Ok 
Reid Fleishman: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWavdil1Kno&feature=youtu.be Ok this is the almost finished version 
Michael Lu: Looks good! 
Reid Fleishman: Thx Iâll just record myself saving a part bc it works for me Ok, that is what I did.  I will post it to the classroom and website today Ok so do u think youâll be able to record a few more tutorials this week? 
Michael Lu: Prob 
Reid Fleishman: Also if u watch the video I ended up getting that error too It must be some issue with inventor 2020 So I figured out how to fix it (itâs not the best way) and I explained it in the video 
Michael Lu: Yeah I moved my file Iâm gonna try again when I record the next tutorial 
Reid Fleishman: Ok So far we have one completion for the first one Andrew Dea Iâm gonna take a look at his in a bit 
Michael Lu: Yep I got the email Ambitious kid 
Reid Fleishman: Yeah He completed it like within 2 hours 
Michael Lu: Lol Lesson 2 files Under my leaders folder 
Reid Fleishman: Great!  I will edit that tomorrow Ok done editing assignment #2 Should I post that one as well? 
Michael Lu: Wait a day or two 
Reid Fleishman: Ok So for #3 I think all the lesson would be is you explaining how to read a drawing You can just explain this one And then the students can just cad this from the drawing And we can make the hatch grabber a bonus 
Michael Lu: Ok ð Sounds good Can U resends the image Canât view 
Reid Fleishman: Itâs under my folder on the server under assignment #3 


Conversation:
Reid Fleishman: Ok Iâm gonna post assignment #2 today 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: what do you want me to go over in the drawing 
Reid Fleishman: Just kinda how to read it I guess Like explain what the dimensions mean Explain that when a circle is dimensioned itâs to the center of the circle Explain that the âRâ stands for radius 
Michael Lu: i mean in real life CADDers never receive the blueprint they make the blue print 
Reid Fleishman: Well how else would they know the dimensions on how to CAD this lol 
Michael Lu: hand drawing lol 
Reid Fleishman: Well Letâs just give them this for now 
Michael Lu: alright 
Reid Fleishman: Theyâre gonna freak out with a hand drawing lol 
Michael Lu: good point don't think we need an entire video maybe in the GC assignment just add some notes for what the different symbols mean 
Reid Fleishman: Well can u just do a rly quick like couple min video Prob better if they hear you explaining it 
Michael Lu: alright, but don't make this part of the tutorial eries because they're not rlly learning anything related to using Inventor 
Reid Fleishman: Ok.  Iâll put it on the website but not as a lesson Iâll just put if you need help reading a drawing click here to access this video 
Michael Lu: sounds good they're cadding the aluminum arm from last year right 
Reid Fleishman: Yeah The drawing file should be in my assignment #3 folder 
Michael Lu: do you know what the * is next to .1630 
Reid Fleishman: no clue ignore it 
Michael Lu: ok video 3 done check my folder for clips also for lesson 4 
Reid Fleishman: Nice 
Michael Lu: there's a part where we demonstrate constrains in real life with two blocks and use tape and glue to portray flush and mate, respectively you have better video cameras so can u do that part i don't have any good cameras or camera stands 
Reid Fleishman: I donât have any either lol I just always borrow deeps and Saifâs 
Michael Lu: i guess maybe saif can do it 
Reid Fleishman: Ok Can u ask him? 
Michael Lu: yeah i'll do it in our CAD Cave group chat 
Reid Fleishman: K In the meantime you can work on the other parts of the vid 
Michael Lu: yep 
Reid Fleishman: Can u post as much as you have done with #4 by tonight bc Iâm leaving for my program at Penn tomorrow and I want to get as much done as possible before that (I will have to edit the remaining ones there tho so it will take a bit longer for me to do that) 
Michael Lu: k i'll try my best 
Reid Fleishman: Thx Just whatever u have done by the time u go to sleep lol 
Michael Lu: #4 should be done also if u don't mind opening the CAD Files for #4 and testing if they work i have a bunch of saving errors so i want to make sure they can be opened by students 
Reid Fleishman: Yeah it opens So r these blocks gonna be what the students are assembling?  Bc ik the assignment was to give them parts to assemble 
Michael Lu: umm maybe i'll make something a bit more complex 
Reid Fleishman: Ok I guess you can just make some more complex parts and then weâll tell the students to assemble them however they like as long as they use all the different Constraints and offsets and stuff 
Michael Lu: where should i put these parts 
Reid Fleishman: Your folder is fine 
Michael Lu: ok make sure u put that in the assignment where to get the files 
Reid Fleishman: Yeah 


Conversation:
Reid Fleishman: Howâs #5 going 
Michael Lu: Very long Done 1/3 Halfway thru going over all the parts 
Reid Fleishman: Ok Lmk if you need help with anything 
Michael Lu: Maybe start planning out the other lessons Outline format Especially the drawing one 
Reid Fleishman: Ok if I can find some free time while Iâm at Penn Iâll work on that 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: First half of five is done All the parts are briefly reviewed 
Reid Fleishman: Ok nice 
Michael Lu: For some parts (such as mechanum and Omni wheels) the explanation would be helped by a video Like some explanations are bad with just words So feel free to edit in supplementary explanations or video demonstrations of the part 
Reid Fleishman: Wait did u not show them all of cad? 
Michael Lu: I do But CAD can only do so much 
Reid Fleishman: Oh ok 
Michael Lu: Like how to you demonstrate an a mechanum wheel drive train moving around 
Reid Fleishman: Ah ok I can find footage of that online From other teams 
Michael Lu: Yeah there are some parts where my explanation is meh 
Reid Fleishman: Ok 
Michael Lu: So definitely add vids if u find it necessary 
Reid Fleishman: Iâll try to figure something out 
Michael Lu: Pls delete empty video clips folder in lesson 5A And rename âCAD Tutorial Lesson 5Aâ (which has all the files) âVideo Clipsâ Server is giving me an error Lol thx 
Reid Fleishman: Lol it was giving me an error too bc I was trying to look at it too 
Michael Lu: Loll 
Reid Fleishman: It doesnât work with 2 ppl at the same time 
Michael Lu: Yeah I closed everything now 
Reid Fleishman: I canât delete it It says itâs in use Hold on a few let me connect to my server admin account 
Michael Lu: Oh dear 
Reid Fleishman: Then I can do whatever I want ;) Ok it should be good now 


Conversation:
Reid Fleishman: Did u ever email that team back who wanted to join our cad summer program? 
Michael Lu: I forwarded them to you And told them that youâd set them up I thought I told u this 
Reid Fleishman: Oh ok, I will try to set them up I didnât realize u told them that Do I just use the email address that u sent me 
Michael Lu: Yep You could just send them the assignment list and the video links 
Reid Fleishman: Yeah Iâll just send them the link to the website Also to the parts library 
Michael Lu: Yep 
Reid Fleishman: Ok Iâll do that later today Also are we responsible for giving them our inventor accounts 
Michael Lu: Yeah prob 
Reid Fleishman: Or should I tell them to make their own inventor account 
Michael Lu: They might not know how Idk up to your 
Reid Fleishman: Bc ik ours is like wacky with licenses (itâs like way overused) 
Michael Lu: Maybe use another email 
Reid Fleishman: Ok Iâll create another email address I was talking to someone at my Penn program who has an Frc team and they use fusion 360.  Just curious, do u know anything about that? 
Michael Lu: Lol nope 5B done

Reid Fleishman: I can just record a quick video on how to troubleshoot the constraint errors since saif is not responding I have a bit of time tomorrow But how exactly do you trouble shoot them besides just kinda deleting ones around the one thatâs causing an error and then redoing them Also I finished 5a and 5b and I can just add that to 5b 
Michael Lu: Honestly itâs very situational And itâs mainly just deleting constraints, which I went over 
Reid Fleishman: Ok, then we probably donât need to have it in a video 
Michael Lu: Yeah if anything A power point is fine 
Reid Fleishman: Ok Also Iâm about to post a long thing I wrote about saving your work often I hope that finally gets ppl to save Once and for all 
Michael Lu: Yep 
Reid Fleishman: Also I put a section of myself talking about some stuff related to the parts library and a few other things in the beginning of 5b 
Michael Lu: Yep thatâs fine 
Reid Fleishman: Ok I put the lock collars I will republish it to the website 
Michael Lu: 6 should be done 
Reid Fleishman: I probably wonât be able to release it until next weekend Iâm very busy this week But #5 should keep ppl busy We can still see ur addres s

Conversation:
Reid Fleishman: I got an email back from that person Should I forward it to ur school email so u can see it or does that not work anymore? 
Michael Lu: What did it say Thatâs fine no need to forward 
Reid Fleishman: Although what exactly does she mean by the last line in the 1st paragraph? 
Michael Lu: Maybe compare submissions? Maybe this person isnât a mentor but rather a team member 
Reid Fleishman: Maybe I DJ Idk*

Conversation:

Ryan Lee: Yeah that'd be great!

Ryan Lee: Swift, react native, etc https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanlee7132/ 
Michael Lu: give me a pitch of ur experience in software dev so i can give a kickass referall how long have u been programming for 
Ryan Lee: Full-stack developer with additional experience in UIX, design, and network architecture. Worked as a backend engineer at a game dev studio, built cross-platform applications for two nonprofits, and worked on apps with React Native and Android Studio. 
Michael Lu: dope how many years 
Ryan Lee: 3

Ryan Lee: Worked at MindIsle Games on a mobile game called Fourzy 20 hrs a week for 3 months 
Michael Lu: Dope do u care abt getting paid? 
Ryan Lee: Preferable 
Michael Lu: Ok no guarantees but Iâll try to muscle some money out of this guy His âbudget is smallâ 
Ryan Lee: He can pay a fixed rate for the project, instead of hourly if he wants 
Michael Lu: would suggest updating your linked in profile and adding any software experience before this dude checks it Itâll make u more legit Also good to have before u job hunt in the future Iâm deadass working on ur referral rn lol 
Ryan Lee: Thanks I think I can import my old profile 
Michael Lu: Make sure ur app dev mindisle thing gets into ur LinkedIn, thatâs a rlly competitive edge Also could u send me ur email for the dude 
Ryan Lee: Too bad I don't have my h2hacks email anymore lol ryanlee7132@gmail.com 
Michael Lu: sent eom Brandon Burke will hopefully get back to you soon He should be legit, and his project seems aight and dope 
Ryan Lee: Thanks for the help Updated my linkedin 
Michael Lu: dope GL on college decisions and lmk if u need anything else regarding this job shit or any job shit in the future Get ur ass prepared 
Ryan Lee: Nice Check out my LinkedIn now lol Finished it do you have a screenshot of the project details or his initial message to you? 
Michael Lu: "Hello Michael,

My name is Brandan and I am looking to find a student-app developer to work on a protect. It is an app similar to Uber but within the beauty industry. Do you have any students that you would recommend?" 
Ryan Lee: So the update They need me to do all the development in 10 weeks. Full stack -- design, programming, etc, and I'd be working on this by myself It's a pretty cool idea so I think I'm gonna accept the offer 
Michael Lu: Dope 


Conversation:
Ryan Lee: Yo just wondering, how's MIT I see you got an internship already lol 
Michael Lu: Aight Hard Fun 
Ryan Lee: Lmao I bet you're gonna get easy job offers at FAANG when you graduate 
Michael Lu: Hahahaha one would hope How is ur software stuff doing 
Ryan Lee: Yo I got the UI all done Wanna see? 
Michael Lu: Sure Sounds dope! 
Ryan Lee: Took a long ass time but next im gonna work on the Postgresql and oauth 
Michael Lu: Sounds sick Whatâs their app Supposed to do He only mentioned Uber for beauty Whatever that means 
Ryan Lee: Yeah basically Barbers come to you So you can order some beauty services and stuff I'd describe it on my resume as building a service and delivery platform for the beauty/comestics industry where professionals can offer their services and network with each other It's a mixture of Uber/instagram 
Michael Lu: Interesting 
Ryan Lee: Bc they want a global feed feature with posts and following users and stuff As well as having Barbers and makeup people coming to you 
Michael Lu: So have they just developed the app so far or are they looking for VC funding at all? Like have they spoken to any potential clients? As well? 
Ryan Lee: They've formed a LLC 
Michael Lu: Ah Classic LLC 
Ryan Lee: Unfortunately they're not really the startup type guys 
Michael Lu: Wdym Lol 
Ryan Lee: I'd describe this as a small business They don't know how to launch a startup 
Michael Lu: Most ppl donât 
Ryan Lee: They don't even know how to do funding rounds 
Michael Lu: I mean if theyâre an LLC Hahah most people donât 
Ryan Lee: They just want to start marketing this after I'm done And that's their launch lol 
Michael Lu: Yeah well âsoftware startupsâ are very ambiguous in their legal definition From what Iâve seen they can range anywhere from A hackathon project To an actual corporation Also Iâve heard that LLCs donât get nice treatment from VCs 
Ryan Lee: Yeah It's true Honestly I don't think these guys are gonna kick off 
Michael Lu: Are they paying you? 
Ryan Lee: They seem amateur And not really 
Michael Lu: Oh lol Could be worse 
Ryan Lee: I'm going to the career fair at my college this September To get a real internship 
Michael Lu: Well what I will say in my experience with internships Is that you need to bang out the fake ones Before you can get the real ones Especially as a freshman So doing âworkâ in high school always helps Because you can always make it look ârealâ 
Ryan Lee: Yeah I'm planning to leverage my hackathon experience and projects, and my high school "work" experience to help me get the internship 
Michael Lu: Yep thatâs how you do it 
Ryan Lee: Since a lot of CS majors haven't done shit before entering lol 
Michael Lu: At least getting your foot in the door with an interview Sometimes true 
Ryan Lee: how'd you land your thing with ibm? 
Michael Lu: Itâs an MIT specific program Like only MIT students apply 
Ryan Lee: Paid? 
Michael Lu: Yeah So basically The month of January is like A period where you can do whatever you want at MIT one of the options is to do an Externships So a lot of companies, each with an MIT alumn take MIT applicants And you get screened and interviewed before they choose who they want 
Ryan Lee: Dang Pretty nice I'm actually curious how we're gonna do in the industry in the future I'm planning to do co-ops and summer internships every year 
Michael Lu: Yeah thatâs an option Where are you going btw next year Do they allow co ops? Because I know some schools donât 
Ryan Lee: I'm going to RIT 
Michael Lu: Nice nice! Congrats Do they let you co-op? 
Ryan Lee: It's actually one of their main things 
Michael Lu: Thatâs dope 
Ryan Lee: They require students to co-op to graduate 
Michael Lu: Thatâs good 
Ryan Lee: https://www.rit.edu/co-op People usually coop every year at RIT 
Michael Lu: Interesting Do they have any travel abroad programs? Iâd suggest doing that at least once 
Ryan Lee: The coop's are paid too, and yeah I'm pretty sure they do 
Michael Lu: Dope Yeah Iâm sure you can land some good offers with ur resume 
Ryan Lee: Yeah good thing about cs is that you don't need to go to a big name school to get a good job 
Michael Lu: Yeah CS is one of the most flexible industry areas A good chunk of CS employees donât even have a CS degree 
Ryan Lee: You'd definitely get a lot of offers though, you got the name recognition plus the resume are people at your school usually like that? like industry-focused 
Michael Lu: A lot are Because a lot of people are CS so it goes hand in hand But a lot of people like to do fun stuff over summer and winter breaks Like study abroad Campus research Or take classes 
Ryan Lee: Sounds pretty cool you busy with anything rn? dont wanna bother you too much lmao 
Michael Lu: Haha not much to do with online classes 
Ryan Lee: Oh yeah, our graduation, prom, and everything is cancelled rip 
Michael Lu: That sucks lol 


Conversation:
Ryan Lee: Yo check out the app I built for those guys https://photos.app.goo.gl/WBDAS4dG9TyhXyS1A it's almost done and by may 11 I'm gonna work with them to publish it on the appstore 
Michael Lu: Good shit my dude Is this the same app idea? 
Ryan Lee: Yup How's your ibm internship going? 
Michael Lu: Oh that ended a while ago lol 
Ryan Lee: Ah what r u doing now then 
Michael Lu: Oh like this summer? 
Ryan Lee: Yeah 
Michael Lu: Iâm working for some company called ABB Doing some power supply shit 
Ryan Lee: Lit 
Michael Lu: That gets sold to other companies So they can run servers and factories 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: the place I'm working at rn is using a node js backend very annoying 
Ryan Lee: I use React and firebase Don't need a backend ;) 
Michael Lu: lol yeah I heard firebase is OP how does it work I know ur team was using it at MIT blueprint 
Ryan Lee: Database, authentication, everything u need Just make an API call 
Michael Lu: you still need backend code right? 
Ryan Lee: No React has a firebase library You can make the rest api call with the client sdk from your front-end 
Michael Lu: how do you do backend logic 
Ryan Lee: JS 
Michael Lu: sounds like firebase is a serverless backend hosting service? 
Ryan Lee: Well it's on the cloud 
Michael Lu: yup and they only host backend Node JS code? 
Ryan Lee: It's not cloud deployment 
Michael Lu: but it hosts your backend in the cloud, no? 
Ryan Lee: No you don't need a backend I call the Firebase functions directly from react 
Michael Lu: and those firebase functions are written in JS? 
Ryan Lee: yarn add firebase yeah 
Michael Lu: dope 
Ryan Lee: Yo do u know React state? Yo my code base for the app is huge 33 files, 1897 lines of code 
Michael Lu: Dam lol

Conversation:
Saad Satter: Mr. Ling I have crucial business to talk with you. If you choose to accept it's a lot of work, if you choose to decline this conversation never happened. Would you like to hear it out? 
Michael Lu: tell me the premise tomorrow in soc i gotta sleep now 
Saad Satter: Probably would take a lot longer to explain than a few minutes in soc. But if you wish Btw that meme was copyrighted  I heard the coolest man on earth made it  And gn Just letting you know that the subject has less to do with me and more about Devan 
Michael Lu: what about it 
Saad Satter: I'm going to try to break it down as easily texting allows I guess I'll start from the beginning that Devan wants to help the world and he is asking for people to join and help him to do that 
Michael Lu: ???? 
Saad Satter: Sounds far fetched He wants a group to start a company and soon gain enough money to have political influence.  A side result would be us with a lot of money, a lot of work, and a lot of time thinking. But the top one percent didn't wake up one morning to change the world. It took all the effort one man can offer. Tbh I don't think the goal will be reached I just thought it would be fun I highly doubt you are interested in this stuff. And wouldn't be surprised if you said no. But let me know what you think about it. Btw us 3 isn't the limitation. I want to bring as many people from the school possible  (suitable people) 
Michael Lu: what kind of company 
Saad Satter: That has not been decided 


Conversation:

Saad Satter: Either that or its just what we learned today there really isn't anything new it's just the same thing as yesterday but looked at differently 
Michael Lu: no 4th period got HW 
Saad Satter: Oh damn 
Michael Lu: not that we'd do it anyways XD 
Saad Satter: I was just about to say that 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Yo sad Saad* How many ppl came to ur scouting meetin 
Saad Satter: Very funny Harvard. Litty* Which meeting are u talking about 
Michael Lu: The after school one 
Saad Satter: Before the trip? 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Saad Satter: A decent amount. I would say 15-20. Maybe more 
Michael Lu: Holy crap saaaad Ur popular 
Saad Satter: ? Why u ask 
Michael Lu: To see how enthusiastic the kids are 
Saad Satter: Also u should know that I put down in the post that it is essential for kids to come if they want to be on the trip. Which I think gathered more people. 
Michael Lu: Oh Dammit 
Saad Satter: I don't think many people read that part tho. Looking at the people who came 
Michael Lu: XD 
Saad Satter: Is there a reason why ur asking now? 
Michael Lu: Cad Meeting 
Saad Satter: I saw that, but scouting and CAD are not the same. And the timing of the post is important 
Michael Lu: Wdym 
Saad Satter: Like I posted mine prior to trip. Everyone is hyped Now everyone is lax, and don't care 
Michael Lu: Good point 
Saad Satter: And people don't see the importance in CAD as much as in scouting because they are afraid of the learning curve. So they may disregard it all together. 
Michael Lu: Another good â«ï¸ 
Saad Satter: And the fact that the new switch to solid works isn't appealing cause it cost them actual money. Inventor only costed time. 
Michael Lu: Haha I guess you havenât figured out the free trial 
Saad Satter: No I found the 60 day But I'm not getting it cause ik that I won't be using it all the time. 
Michael Lu: Lol oof Never mentioned solidworks tho 
Saad Satter: No it didn't. But something to look out for. Just cause kids come, doesn't mean u will retain them 
Michael Lu: Depends on who comes 
Saad Satter: I'm expecting some power points, and like a trailer video for the meeting 
Michael Lu: You didnât make a trailer for the scouting meeting So nah 
Saad Satter: Well scouting isn't intimidating And it isn't computerized 
Michael Lu: How does a trailer/ppt relate to this 
Saad Satter: How else are u gonna present CAD to those who don't know And how are u gonna catch people who hardly care 
Michael Lu: Because Iâm not looking for inexperienced robotics ppl to show up The people that will show up/join CAD will already know what it is 
Saad Satter: Oh. So like the 2 other members 
Michael Lu: No, builders and freshman know what CAD is 
Saad Satter: Ok so the sophomore white kids or the 2 freshmen who actually care 
Michael Lu: Thatâs already an adequate size 
Saad Satter: Yea Ok, gl with that. At least I'll be there 
Michael Lu: A lot of teams function with < 5 CAD ppl A lot of good teams 
Saad Satter: Describe function. 
Michael Lu: Function = they built a robot that beat our sorry asses at Curie 
Saad Satter: Do they CAD after the robot is built or before 
Michael Lu: Before idc Ofc* 
Saad Satter: Ok, well I wish u luck. If u only need 3 people I think it can be done 
Michael Lu: Thanks I really appreciate it Btw Tell Neves I said hi And then type âSorry, I typed this message in the wrong chat.â Heâll get a good kick out of it 
Saad Satter: Let me get this straight. U want me to write "Litty says hi" and then write "sorry...." 
Michael Lu: If not then choose the latter Itâs an inside joke 
Saad Satter: Ok but u want me to mention u specifically 
Michael Lu: Sure 
Saad Satter: Done 
Michael Lu: XD cool 


Conversation:
Saad Satter: Hey litty, how's your summer going. I was wondering if it's a problem if I learn inventor instead of solidworks Cause I think I'm starting to get a little bit of inventor and I had it installed already 
Michael Lu: Both are fine I think if you save it as the right type of file It might be transferable across softwares 
Saad Satter: Ok, is the school getting solidworks 
Michael Lu: If you want, i can give you a solidworks demo if you ever are curious I need to settle that once school starts 
Saad Satter: Ok, and I'll take u up on that solidworks thing. For now I'm making a drive train on inventor 
Michael Lu: Lmk when u ready 
Saad Satter: Ok Thx 
Michael Lu: It should be on google drive So you can check it if you want (Shared on google) 
Saad Satter: Ok 


Conversation:
Saad Satter: I went to the robotics drive but I don't see any place for any CAD stuff. Do you know which folder it's in

Saad Satter: So for now I've talked to my parents and I'm good, neves is good, Jay is good, Aaron Lee is probably good, and deep is good (if Aaron comes then we won't go with deep), John is probably good as well And zizic can do what he wants cause he makes his own dough 
Michael Lu: Wait when is this 
Saad Satter: So most of us has permission to go. We need to set on who is coming and then a date and everything else

2. Is John and I stuck to being in deeps car since he is in NHP
3. Is Miriam gonna have to join in on our hangouts 
Michael Lu: 1. Eh not rlly
2. Well itâs more practical but no?
3. She can 3. But no 
Saad Satter: Ok. Out of the 3, me and John are more worried about numero 2 Cause deep in the car said he is gonna be the NHP driver from now on and you know how much me and John loves deep 
Michael Lu: Well now that deep Lost an option Again XD 
Saad Satter: Wdym? Cause Miriam is with Aaron? 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Saad Satter: Yea he was low key butt hurt in the ride 
Michael Lu: Haha thank fod God

Michael Lu: Yeah Big lol 
Saad Satter: He kept saying it doesn't bother him at all. But everyone else was kinda shocked about it and didn't see it coming 
Michael Lu: Sameee will Lol 
Saad Satter: Also like they are both into it. But I think Miriam was the main puppet master in arranging it Which I didn't expect either. Also low key wondering if neves is dating Sarah 
Michael Lu: Wouldnât be surprised if Miriam wore the pants 
Saad Satter: That's what I like to hear. No sexual stereotypes 
Michael Lu: ðð there we go progressive Saad

Michael Lu: wby funny Why funny 
Saad Satter: Cause I saw the before pic so I know how it's being done 
Michael Lu: O well fuck Why is it stupid 
Saad Satter: Idk just like seems like your posing for nothing 
Michael Lu: It doesnât seem like Iâm leaning on anything? 
Saad Satter: Ok if I factor in the before pic it's funny. If I don't it just seems like a pose 
Michael Lu: O lol So it doesnât seem like Iâm leaning on anything You donât get the leaning vibe? 
Saad Satter: Like it seems like that's the goal but it's possible that ur just posing 
Michael Lu: Lol ok What abt this one 
Saad Satter: That one looks like your leaning on the screen 
Michael Lu: Is that better? 
Saad Satter: What's your goal here Humor 
Michael Lu: An interesting photo Thatâs somewhat funny 
Saad Satter: Hmmm. This is just my opinion. But either first or second pic would get that funny factor and possibly interesting. The third looks like a standard screen lean photo. 
Michael Lu: Ok ok A ð

Conversation:
Michael Lu: Hey SS When we did the plasma cutter To what diameter did we shrink the holes on CAD before exporting as DXF 
Saad Satter: Uh, I want to say .16 It could have been .19 or .125 
Michael Lu: Or .195 Or .18362828 
Saad Satter: Uhh I mean what's the actual hole diameter 
Michael Lu: This bitch look familiar? 
Saad Satter: That's a beauty Gets me going every time Hey... it's not my fault that Corrigan wanted to over engineer the thing 
Michael Lu: So ima just say when exporting to DXF Make holes .15 Is bigger better 
Saad Satter: Ok 
Michael Lu: Or smaller Fuck the diameter of small hoes is .125 
Saad Satter: I think smaller is better. And if it doesn't work then make it bigger Cause u cant go the other way 
Michael Lu: True true Itâs like getting a vasectomy Small snips first 
Saad Satter: There is no second try with that one 
Michael Lu: Yep 
Saad Satter: Remember, measure twice and cut once 
Michael Lu: Thatâs what the suicidal kids say all the time One cut is all they need if theyâre skilled Because theyâll never get a second chance for the next cut 
Saad Satter: If they use a second cut. Then they did something wrong 
Michael Lu: Dude 
Saad Satter: Yo 
Michael Lu: Date this meme Rate Sushi 
Saad Satter: Uh its aight 
Michael Lu: Fucking hell 
Saad Satter: Almost a giggle 
Michael Lu: Ur a tough nut to crack 
Saad Satter: U have no idea how tough my nut is Why Tryna impress a girl Cause this ain't the way 
Michael Lu: Yeah u wish 
Saad Satter: Tryna impress a guy? Ok. U do u 
Michael Lu: Sure letâs go with that 
Saad Satter: Wow I think gloria would it funny. But she finds most things funny 
Michael Lu: Tbh Girls have lower humor standards 
Saad Satter: Except when we have our twisted humor 
Michael Lu: All my guy friends think Iâm a dipshit for humor But in my yearbook Shit ton of girls think Iâm funny 
Saad Satter: That's a fact Ok 
Michael Lu: 1 saad chuckle = a girl dies of laughter 
Saad Satter: Sounds about right 
Michael Lu: Fuck u and ur steel nuts 
Saad Satter: But I have like a range of humor. From dark and twisted stuff to like stupid stuff Like I love this meme 
Michael Lu: I donât U weird ass 
Saad Satter: Ur a tough nut to crack Although no one appreciated our sarah and neves joke. I mean miriam would not like it and aaron is dating miriam and neves at this point. Zizic backed off. 
Michael Lu: Oh Sarah found out abt it lol 
Saad Satter: How 
Michael Lu: Idfk 
Saad Satter: Dammit Aaron 100 bucks it was aaron who told miriam who told sarah Wait how do u know that sarah knows 
Michael Lu: She messaged me the photoshopped message I made I guess I didnât delet in time 
Saad Satter: Oh Well 
Michael Lu: Oh well 
Saad Satter: Its fine. Gotta make ur own fun in life. Have u hungout with anyone from the group recently 
Michael Lu: I was with Erick and deep and Enoch Last week I think Tbh a lot of the planning happens on snap chat And then the discussion of the hangout occurs on messenger So lol Iâm always late to the game 
Saad Satter: I mean the group kinda split up Cause some people had problems with others And I don't mean between deep and non deep people. I mean others 
Michael Lu: Yeah duh Oh wait I heard abt John and Miriam? Like John made her upset or something 
Saad Satter: Oh yea But that was different So basically john has a problem with aaron. And miriam asked why john was avoiding her. And john said he was avoiding aaron not her. And she was upset that aaron was being targets But yes some people have problems with aaron. Some with deep. Some with neves 
Michael Lu: I heard Aaron was because of prom 
Saad Satter: Yea that was the start 
Michael Lu: Then what 
Saad Satter: And just got worse from there I mean. You don't have a problem with aaron. So idk if you really need to know this 
Michael Lu: I mean Ur probs r my probs Besides ur unusually stiff balls 
Saad Satter: Well, it's not entirely my problems. I just know about others and how its there's. But if you have a good relation with the 3 I mentioned. Then keep it ig. If you really want to get in on this. I can only say in vague ish terms 
Michael Lu: Dam So basically deep Aaron and neves R no bueno! ? 
Saad Satter: I mean deep you know 
Michael Lu: And all three also happen to be in a relationship Lol 
Saad Satter: Wait is deep and vivian serious 
Michael Lu: Idk thatâs besides the point 
Saad Satter: But yea, main idea is that the 3 are no bueno 
Michael Lu: Why Is it bc of their dating life 
Saad Satter: Uh, that's a part of it? I think it has to do with how their personality changed due to it 
Michael Lu: Oh How do They change U mean they care more abt Their girls So they sideline us 
Saad Satter: So I won't say who said what 
Michael Lu: Lol obviously either u or John 
Saad Satter: Actually not me 
Michael Lu: Keerthi cant speak He doesnât speak 
Saad Satter: I just hear it from others Besides John 
Michael Lu: So that narrows it down to the other brown man John 
Saad Satter: It doesn't matter who 
Michael Lu: True 
Saad Satter: But like they say that Neves ego grew a lot since dating life and he also has everyone in the group "worshipping him" (I don't think I worship him but ok) and they find it kinda annoying 
Michael Lu: I havenât hung out with him in a while Yeah ppl def change when they get a gf Itâs like going from bronze league to silver 
Saad Satter: And aaron acts more like an ass hole. In short Aaron to me personally was only an asshole when it came to rides. He always made me ride with deep and he made me feel like living in new hyde park was a disability. Like he was forbidden to go there 
Michael Lu: I mean gas money tho Idk 
Saad Satter: Ok. I drive to great neck all the time 
Michael Lu: Or he didnât understand how much u hated deep 
Saad Satter: One time I confronted him about it He let me ride with him to the beach After that, no more 
Michael Lu: Yeah I remember the beach rides lol 
Saad Satter: And he forgot about keerthi on beach day. I reminded him apparently. I don't remember but its possible Also someone said that aaron always only cared for himself at the end. 
Michael Lu: Lol have u been talking to Gloria abt this? 
Saad Satter: No 
Michael Lu: Oh lol 
Saad Satter: Why 
Michael Lu: Idk she thinks Aaron is a terrible person sometimes 
Saad Satter: Ha Well ig that's one more Actually no that makes sense 
Michael Lu: Idk 
Saad Satter: I mean none of this really affects you ig. 
Michael Lu: Well yeah because I havenât been hanging out with neves or Aaron Last time I saw them was toy story 4 
Saad Satter: I mean it's just people are having trouble getting along with those in relationships I suppose 
Michael Lu: Wouldnât be surprised Relationships fuck up friendships 
Saad Satter: That's unfortunate Have you heard Like aaron and miriam were saying how they could see themselves getting married 
Michael Lu: ððð 
Saad Satter: Yea they've been dating for like 2 months And aaron said he would transfer to Tuffs 
Michael Lu: Ballsy ass move 
Saad Satter: Yea idk. They got real serious real fast 
Michael Lu: Well I guess weâll see how long distance treats them 
Saad Satter: I don't even know how sarah and neves are really doing. All I know is that neves is a bank Broadway Musicals for date Money draining 
Michael Lu: Wtf U deadass! I mean he has a job $13 an hour at least 
Saad Satter: Useless job 
Michael Lu: Hey man Cash is cash No matter how itâs acquired ð 
Saad Satter: Cash is cash. If you have it. Not if u spend it 
Michael Lu: Lol true 
Saad Satter: And his job is dependent on deep. 
Michael Lu: No itâs at parkwood 
Saad Satter: Oh really 
Michael Lu: Lol u dumbassss 
Saad Satter: He changed it? 
Michael Lu: Yurrr No he never got deeps thing Iâm pretty sure 
Saad Satter: HAHAH He still makes more money than me :(. But I don't got to spend money on relationships 
Michael Lu: True He actually goes broadwAy? 
Saad Satter: Ye 
Michael Lu: Whoâd u hear that from 
Saad Satter: Apparently one day. That's all he talked about Not saying 
Michael Lu: We Wow Wait Does he pay for both tickets 
Saad Satter: I hear that's a possibility 
Michael Lu: Wow What a champ Taking a hard ass hit In the wallet 
Saad Satter: Apparently he had his own "depression funds" and they running low now 
Michael Lu: Dam 
Saad Satter: I mean at this point I just steer clear from all 3. 
Michael Lu: Yup 
Saad Satter: But do what u want. Idrc. Like this group has more drama than any other friend group I ever had And I'm rooming with aaron and neves 
Michael Lu: Lol

Saad Satter: I did But I dont think I did it right 
Michael Lu: Okay hold on Iâll use my nspire Ur derivatives look correct 
Saad Satter: Well that should have been the hard part.  Now it's just system of equations But I dont get the right answers 
Michael Lu: 3 pairs to try? Wait nvm 4 
Saad Satter: Yea I'll try them 
Michael Lu: x=-sqrt(6)/2 y=0 x=0 and y = -sqrt(2)/2 x=0 and y=0 x=0 and y=sqrt(2)/2 x=sqrt(6)/2 y=0 Fuck lol thatâs five Do u know how to do the second derivative test 
Saad Satter: Yea the determinant right 
Michael Lu: Yeah fxxfyy-fxy^2 or whatever 
Saad Satter: Yea 
Michael Lu: For the second question Fuck you what were you going to type Lol 
Saad Satter: Oh idk 
Michael Lu: Oh lol For the second question There an algebraic way to do it But it takes a long ass time So just use ur calculator Unless they want u to do it algebraically 
Saad Satter: Algebraic 
Michael Lu: R u fucking serious Like actually you have to do it algebraically? 
Saad Satter: Ok how do u do it with calculator 
Michael Lu: Wait do u actually need to learn it algebraically tho 
Saad Satter: Uh Its like a summation or something But I dont think its gonna be tested Let's use calculator for now 
Michael Lu: what kinda calc do u have 
Saad Satter: CSS CAS 
Michael Lu: in case they test it anyways go to new doc lists and spreadsheets

Saad Satter: Lol Thx bby 
Michael Lu: U better get that fucking shit right If it doesnât work lmk 
Saad Satter: Yea I'm starting to enter the values now. How did u do the system of equations 
Michael Lu: Calculator Fuck algebra Basically solve the two equations when theyâre set to 0 Idk how the fuck to do it by hand 
Saad Satter: So u just set them equal? Cause like by hand its fucking cancer 
Michael Lu: Yeah that shit is 
Saad Satter: And no calculator on test 
Michael Lu: Fuck that Thatâs above my pay grade Can u factor anything 
Saad Satter: I factored out the e^1-whatev and canceled them out. But then I got stuck Ok the regression line worked What did u get for your z values for those numbers 
Michael Lu: Lmao what 
Saad Satter: Like I need an x,y,z point 
Michael Lu: Fuck I ainât doin that shit Plug it in urself bitch Lmao 
Saad Satter: I did It still says its wrong 
Michael Lu: Every single one? 
Saad Satter: Well I tried one of them 
Michael Lu: Well try the others first 
Saad Satter: The 0,0 was right 
Michael Lu: Thatâs it ? 
Saad Satter: Ok wait another worked Maybe I did the first one wrong Idk my larger y value seems wrong 
Michael Lu: M shit saad suck my dick 
Saad Satter: Dont tempt me 
Michael Lu: Flip ur x and y For the shit thatâs wrong x = 0 y = +-sqrt(2)/2 
Saad Satter: Lol Look at that Beauty 
Michael Lu: Yeah fuck yeah saad Now go read this shit if u want to algebraically do linear regression 
Saad Satter: Lmao How do u plan to do this on tests if u use the calculator 
Michael Lu: Wdym 
Saad Satter: Like does ur teacher give easier questions than these to do by hand on an exam 
Michael Lu: Idfk

Michael Lu: Aight aight Iâll lyk when Iâm free Iâm gonna call in a few min 
Saad Satter: Aight

Conversation:
Michael Lu: Send me a sketch then call tmrw I am still caddying scissor lift Found a 30mm/s linear actuator 
Saad Satter: Uk Ok 
Michael Lu: I might just blow out our money on that instead of a lot of vex parts 
Saad Satter: Also I got an idea for the front chest plate 
Michael Lu: Yeah whatâs up 
Saad Satter: Instead of lowering it with a pulley we would put it on a rotating platform. I'll send a sketch in like 2min 
Michael Lu: Ok Rotating platform sounds like a torque nightmare 
Saad Satter: Oh plz. We already established that motors are too powerful. 
Michael Lu: Who said weâre using them tho 
Saad Satter: No one 
Michael Lu: Send a sketch tho 
Saad Satter: Just an idea 
Michael Lu: I might have the wrong idea Of what shit looks like 
Saad Satter: Btw we have to use a motor either case so far if we donât want linear actuators 
Michael Lu: Dam this motor has to be a big bitch tho 
Saad Satter: The other idea is a winch but I still need a viable engagement mechanism 
Michael Lu: True If we can get ur rotating platform to work It would be a bit better maybe But The radius we are working with is 30 inches 
Saad Satter: Also a rotating platform matches tony thing better. Not that we have to or anything 
Michael Lu: Idk bout that lol It was unclear in the clip Well One idea is to let it free fall rotate Hmmm 
Saad Satter: Just like push it past 90 degrees? And then it just swings 
Michael Lu: Or let it fall Like have a pin that gets pulled out Or some shit 
Saad Satter: Just linearly down? 
Michael Lu: No for your rotating platform Like ur saying have the chest plate on a swing? Like lowkey 
Saad Satter: No no. Ok stop. I think I know what you mean. Let me sketch Like that? Forget the motor 
Michael Lu: Yes but maybe no 
Saad Satter: What tf does that mean Am I understanding your point correctly 
Michael Lu: Open the hit box assembl 30 inch drop From top of shed to chest plate area We donât have the real estate to have a 30 inch protrusion When the platform is in the up state 
Saad Satter: Ok so two quick thoughts. 1 we can go back to the motor. 2 we can just let the platform extrude further than the ceiling 
Michael Lu: 1. Sure I guesss
2. Wdym 
Saad Satter: Ok Lol 
Michael Lu: What we can do Something like a fucking turret Maybe 
Saad Satter: Great so we need two beefy motors Instead of 1 
Michael Lu: Or we could just use 1 beefy motor For a fucking 270 degree rotation 
Saad Satter: Yea Sounds about right 
Michael Lu: I mean if u want But weâre gonna need some high ass ceilings I think the turret ainât a bad idea If we keep everything light 
Saad Satter: Are we building the robotics arms for the helmet under the ceiling ? 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Saad Satter: Hmm Ok so which way do you wanna go? Turret? 
Michael Lu: Why other ideas do u have 
Saad Satter: Well I had another idea but I scratched it cause it needed 2 motors. And I think less motors the better 
Michael Lu: Whatâs ur idea 
Saad Satter: It's two separate rotations I'll send a sketch 
Michael Lu: The turret needs two rotations lol I donât understand this Whatâs the purple Box Is that the sheâs? Sheâs 
Saad Satter: Oh the purple is the front chest plate 
Michael Lu: The other purple 
Saad Satter: Yea ok maybe I can sketch it better Oh the dark purple is the ceiling posts 
Michael Lu: Interesting idea 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: btw 
Saad Satter: Cool cool What sketch btw are you leaning towards for the front chest plate 
Michael Lu: fuck lowkey turret but it is very geometry dependent 
Saad Satter: Do you want me to try to cad a few of them 
Michael Lu: i would go check the CAD yeah for a few of them like get the geometric jist 
Saad Satter: Ok 
Michael Lu: with constrained boxes in the hitbox assembly 
Saad Satter: Ye ye 
Michael Lu: gmorning cunt lmk when u got some drawings on CAD or what decision you have come to and we can discuss tonight breifly 
Saad Satter: Ok sure So these are just two general ideas but I'll explain my worries about them more when we talk 
Michael Lu: When to talk 
Saad Satter: Idk When do you wanna talk 
Michael Lu: Now cunt Now If u can 
Saad Satter: Ok give me like 5min or so

Conversation:
Michael Lu: 10pm tonight 
Saad Satter: Yea I've been working on the block cad for your design first before I start the actual cad. And it seems a little tight as far as spacing Like what di you have in mind for that arm to be made out of 2x4? 
Michael Lu: Might be a custom cut of plywood Two 3/4 inch pieces put together for a 1.5 inch thick piece 
Saad Satter: Ok Ig that's better 
Michael Lu: Will be on at 10:20, gotta take a shower real quick Wya 
Saad Satter: I'm on skype

Saad Satter: Oh Jesus Ok 
Michael Lu: Lol wait I thought ur almost done Itâs rlly the dimensions I care about Doesnât have to be squeaky perfect 
Saad Satter: Oh Ok I'll put it in tonight But I'm kinda fighting against the clock here with some lab 
Michael Lu: Nah itâs all good no rush Just a heads up

Conversation:
Michael Lu: Is motor shaking only a problem at high RPM? 
Saad Satter: I wouldn't say "High", but like if its not moving glacialy slow, I would be expecting it to shake 
Michael Lu: 60 RPM worst case tho 1 rotation per second 
Saad Satter: Ok so I would suggest this. Prepare for the motor to be shaking If it doesn't. No harm no foul. But if it does, well it can be avoided Like even if you want to 3D print a motor stand and hot glue it to the block of wood That works too 
Michael Lu: Iâm just wondering how many motor mounts we need 
Saad Satter: Well the one for the shoulder we are gonna have to make But yea we need that one I haven't looked at the other DC motors but probably same deal 
Michael Lu: Aight 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Yo I think the price just dropped 
Saad Satter: What was it before 
Michael Lu: I think it was $20 Or maybe I just rounded up lol 
Saad Satter: Good chance it did drop with no one really buying much online But who knows 
Michael Lu: Lmao 14 in stock left 
Saad Satter: Oh my We aren't even sure what we need yet 
Michael Lu: I mean Open ur eyes And youâll see how many fucking servos are used in this project 
Saad Satter: What are u gonna do? Empty the stock 
Michael Lu: Lmao We shall see We shall see 
Saad Satter: Lol. Very reassuring I know I said this in the past. But if u need me to buy anything just ask I was just thinking I think we may need more than 14 I count 12 for the robotic arms alone. At least And then we have 2 for shoulders and 4 for arms 
Michael Lu: Mother fuck lol I already have 6 at home 
Saad Satter: Oh So we just need the rest of the stock I mean idk if we are using servos for any of the chest plates. But so far we also need 2 for upper leg Thats 20 
Michael Lu: Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck We need to find cheaper options for some of these Btw lmk if u can meet tmrw night 
Saad Satter: Home made servos Yea i can meet tomorrow night 
Michael Lu: Fuckoffffff lol 
Saad Satter: Ok so fuck one of the servos and we use a fucking drill instead Put that shit on high torque and just whack those pieces on till it sticks 
Michael Lu: Lol funny funny 
Saad Satter: Or we can use a shaft that goes out of screen and spin it by hand Dw we'll find a way 
Michael Lu: I want u To pull your dick off For saying that 
Saad Satter: Great another good idea Dick is a shaft too 
Michael Lu: If one of our dicks is long enough to put us off camera 
Saad Satter: Dw, I gotchu 
Michael Lu: If the thing works flawlessly Then our dicks will probably grow enough 
Saad Satter: Thats a fact

Saad Satter: Sam go, showing mech ainât that cool 
Michael Lu: Lmfao RIP 
Saad Satter: Yo I appreciate you coming to the alumni meet. I mean I know you say school doesn't matter. But to them, hearing someone from MIT saying to kinda go to whatever school you like meant more than it coming from me And also good input on like the various parts of EE and CS 
Michael Lu: Lol dope Iâm yeah had a rlly fun time This is good shit saad, also nice to see the alumn And answer Eric Wangs 10382828192 questions 
Saad Satter: Lmao Yea definitely seeing old alumni was the highlight as well as revealing the truth behind the real takeaway from frc 
Michael Lu: Yeah yeah Also if they need Would be down to do a CS specific 
Saad Satter: Yea i can arrange something like that. Unless u want to 
Michael Lu: Donât have discord 
Saad Satter: You can do it on fb 
Michael Lu: Nope 
Saad Satter: Ok 
Michael Lu: Donât want motch Or foreign 
Saad Satter: I'll see about it 
Michael Lu: Corrigan Lmao ask Enoch 
Saad Satter: Yea How about you ask enoch and Jay I'll handle the setup 
Michael Lu: Yeah down 
Saad Satter: Ask Newman too 
Michael Lu: Newman ððð 
Saad Satter: Like all of you guys are going to amazing schools but different ones Like Stanford and Berkeley and Cornell and Mit 
Michael Lu: Jay goes to USC dum dum 
Saad Satter: Same thing 
Michael Lu: Yeah fuck west coast 
Saad Satter: Except ben 
Michael Lu: Yes yes 
Saad Satter: You know we have an amazing Ben in stony Not amazing school related but an amazing person. Like mad nice and chill. We worship him 
Michael Lu: All gens Ben Wait 
Saad Satter: True 
Michael Lu: Lol ben menchell 
Saad Satter: Hes a legend in his own right Like the shit he did 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Lmao bro It ainât computer engineering Fight me 
Saad Satter: Lmao wait Ik its not the exact same Cause computer engineering is looking at specifically coding hardware But still its the same Tomato tomoto 
Michael Lu: Nah bruh nahahhahagahhghh Wait But ur like Actually learning âcomputer engineeringâ right Itâs not like ur taking just EE and CS classes separately? 
Saad Satter: Andrew dea made notes from the meeting And this is what he put down 
Michael Lu: What the actual fuck Lmao 
Saad Satter: And Noah is arguing whether or not eecs is even a major 
Michael Lu: Fuck lol why not 
Saad Satter: Well in many colleges apparently it is the title of the department Not the major 
Michael Lu: Oh I mean Iâm sure EECS exists elsewhere 
Saad Satter: I think Jennifer luo is also a eecs major In cali 
Michael Lu: Oh lol fantastic 
Saad Satter: Yup Btw i definitely think some kids would be interested in a CS oriented meeting. Or EE and CS. Like not soon but in June or something 
Michael Lu: Yeah thatâd be dope 
Saad Satter: Yea so try to see ig if other CS alumni or EE alumni would be interested Aka. Enoch and Jay and Newman. Ig Gloria is CS and so is John But if there's too many people from our year I'm sure newman wouldn't be too interested 
Michael Lu: So I would make sure to not keep the number too high 
Saad Satter: I mean yea you can keep it small As far as alumni 
Michael Lu: Like around 5 
Saad Satter: Yea I'll probably join just for organization and if we do ee and cs meeting at the same time 
Michael Lu: Dude Everybody who is EECS is basically CS maybe besides u Because ur rlly a computer engineer 
Saad Satter: Yea and another thing is. With all technicality the way I made the survey of majors people are interested in. I did EE/CE(hardware) as one choice and CS/CE(Software) as another And those got the most likes so far. With CS/CE having one more Also how many ee classes do u take 
Michael Lu: Lol So CS BASICALLY WON over meche ? 
Saad Satter: CS and EE and physics and math won over Mech 
Michael Lu: Dam thatâs fucked up Okay well People who said math are gonna be CS And people who said physics are gonna be Mech 
Saad Satter: To be fair only like 7 people voted out of the 14 attended 
Michael Lu: Oh know Lâamour Lmao 
Saad Satter: But people were allowed to vote for multiple majors Still ME came out with like 1 vote 
Michael Lu: Lol what the fuck Xd 
Saad Satter: I have 2 theories. Either they realized what I did and that ME actual job opportunities are pretty low. Like real ME jobs. Or they like CS a lot which is really the wave these days. But like I dont understand anyone who goes into EE. My reasons are not really for most people. So tbh idk 
Michael Lu: Idk Most of them Like donât rlly understand majors 
Saad Satter: Tru Maybe they are just interested in learning about it rather than going into it

Michael Lu: ^basically what 2638 did 
Saad Satter: But they actually can sing

Saad Satter: Yea he is in a program outside of school. 
Michael Lu: Wat that 
Saad Satter: Idk. Itâs costly 
Michael Lu: Wdym costly Itâs non profit 
Saad Satter: Iâm pretty sure he pays to be apart of a program that does non for profit stuff. I can be wrong or I might be thinking of something else 
Michael Lu: That doesnât sound like on profit to me 
Saad Satter: No non for profit is actually non for profit 
Michael Lu: So Instead of customers paying The workers pay to work 
Saad Satter: Yea. I think 
Michael Lu: Lol Interesting

Michael Lu: Oh shit rlly? 
Saad Satter: Yea So its just banner With no memory 
Michael Lu: Lmao wdym Also isnât chairmanâs still Prestigious ish Unless like SPBLI teams were Uber shit this year 
Saad Satter: Yea but like. None of the awards means anything if its not really in person and if there's no championship. Also its SBPLI which downgrades how meaningful the award is 
Michael Lu: Oh because no judges and interviews 
Saad Satter: Yea 
Michael Lu: Dam straight savage saad 
Saad Satter: They just read our books 
Michael Lu: Which are usually just reused 
Saad Satter: Yup And our graduating class this year really doesn't deserve it

Michael Lu: Lmao not every crab has the same privilege as youâd expect sir My crab is offended by ur human privilege and demands you be cancelled after giving an apology that wonât be accepted 
Saad Satter: Bro If that crab doesn't meet my expectations Its not a crab 
Michael Lu: My crab just said Your perception of what a crab is comes from an oppressive patriarchal society that imposes unfair stereotypes and expectations on what a crab must be My crab will not be defined by your oppressive binary interpretation and crab and not-crab 
Saad Satter: Fuck ur crab It don't have right It's We the People, not We the Crab 
Michael Lu: My crab is now so upset That it wants to create a safe space for crabs But itâll first hold a protest in front of your house tomorrow And then itâll try to get you canceled on social media for hurting its feelings 
Saad Satter: What social media 
Michael Lu: And when you go back to Stony Brook Itâll form a blockade at the entrances To block u and all humans from entering campus Because you discriminated against it However, all crabs will be let in 
Saad Satter: I'll eat it I'll eat the crab Yum 
Michael Lu: My crab is now calling u a racist sexist nazi And demands reparations of $50000 
Saad Satter: I broke He can demand it all day 
Michael Lu: Beware there is more than one Fuck *side note my crabs are all RIGHT handed 
Saad Satter: Damn thats racist 
Michael Lu: My crab thinks ur part of the bigoted movement human lives matter Which is an inappropriate response to crab lives matter 
Saad Satter: They don't matter tho I dont get it Crabs are food Sustenance 
Michael Lu: Dam my crab is tired of being offended so it doesnât want to talk to you anymore because itâs feelings are hurt So instead of arbitrating with you and attempting to understand your views It will go back to its crab safe space and watch Vox, CNN, and The Young Turks until it feels better about its horrid situation 
Saad Satter: Lmao Dude im gonna call u Krabi Cause k means its fake crab 
Michael Lu: Lmao donât bring me into this bro

Saif Punjwani: Yup I saw the message on Facebook Iâm coming :D 
Michael Lu: Cool :) 


Conversation:
Saif Punjwani: Hey what happened to the CAD thing? Do u want me to start it? Or did u make the group chat? 
Michael Lu: Waiting for finals to finish So by the end of this week or the start of next week, Iâll get into the specifics. 
Saif Punjwani: Ok thanks :D 


Conversation:
Saif Punjwani: Hey what was assignment two, it was something about 2D Extruded shapes right? I couldnât do it, can u give me the basics so I can do it rn? 
Michael Lu: Just make a cube, sphere, and triangular prism 


Conversation:
Saif Punjwani: Hey I am sorry my assignment 4 isnât that good I had to leave for a flight and didnât have much time to do it, but I will be here for the next assignment, thanks so much :D 
Michael Lu: Lol itâs fine man Most ppl arenât even submitting Keep up the good work, Saif! 
Saif Punjwani: Lmao thatâs true, thx :D 


Conversation:
Saif Punjwani: Hey, I am coming back rly late tonight so I will try to sleep and do the CAD work tomorrow so it might be a little late, just wanted to let you know and also if u can keep assignment 5 up as well, thx :D 


Conversation:
Saif Punjwani: Uploaded :) :D* 


Conversation:
Saif Punjwani: Assignment six will be a little late, went to Washington D.C. for an internship, will be back in a couple days, will have it to you at latest Tuesday, sorry I didnât do it ahead of time and for so much traveling, thanks :D 
Michael Lu: Haha Its fine I didnât even do it My license expired 


Conversation:
Saif Punjwani: Lol, wait Liddy in the Versa chassis on vex itâs not letting me open the CAD STEP MODEL And where do you download the parts from Vex Robotics? 
Michael Lu: Can u send a screen shot for your problem and where you tried to download the drive train? Also for parts? Look under the vexpro page Select parts from the menu And for a specific part you scroll down to the CAD download links 
Saif Punjwani: Ok thanks, Iâll send u a screenshot tomorrow, If I have anymore questions Iâll txt u tmrw, sorry I responded so late See when I try to open it, it just doesnât work And where does it say parts? I see the menu, but I canât find parts Wait I found this, this is it right? Wait I think I know how to do assignment 7, I think I figured out whatâs wrong Wait never mind, here look at this, did I do something wrong? It doesnât show up when I click on the folder, and I unzip it, but it just goes to more folders, and when I tried taking them out and doing it separately still nothing shows up 
Michael Lu: If you unzip the download Can u find an assembly file? ^for the drive train In general, when you unzip the folder, where do you unzip it to? 
Saif Punjwani: No I canât, when I unzip it, it just shows me to this internet explorer thing and doesnât work, wherever I unzip it (for the drive train), and when I unzip the folder I unzip it in another folder for everything, and it shows me the parts but, when I click insert components and then click on the folder nothing shows up Is there any way u have a working folders that you could send to me? Or do u know anything else I can do Thx for helping me by the way, itâs being really weird When I tried to import the exercise on the vertanux1 website it worked, I think itâs because it was like the part file/ .SLDASM file 
Michael Lu: When you select parts to insert make sure you are click "all files" at the bottom of the window Solidworks defaults to looking for solidworks files but if you tell it to display "all files" in the insert part window, you should be able to see STEP files 
Saif Punjwani: Ok so you were right, when I clicked all files it worked, thank you so much, but now there is another problem, look It says itâs not compatible 
Michael Lu: Oh my Did my email to you work? 
Saif Punjwani: Yes it did, is this the practice make a drive train for assignment 7? Or Assignment 6, to assemble to parts? Thank you so much And Iâm sorry it was being so glitchy, I know I couldnât control it, but Iâm still sorry Iâm guessing these are for 7 
Michael Lu: Yep 7 
Saif Punjwani: Made progress ð Finally lol 


Conversation:
Saif Punjwani: So I am almost done sorry I took so long I was a counselor at a camp, but I am almost done now, but I am looking for the rivet file and I couldnât find it so I thought I would find it eventually going through the mating process, but I still canât find it, if u forgot to put it in there could you send me the file, thank you and thank you for being so patient 
Michael Lu: A pop river? Donât worry about fasteners 
Saif Punjwani: R u sure? Ok then 
Michael Lu: Yeah we never CAD with fasteners Slows down the process a lot and makes the file unnecessarily big And sluggish 
Saif Punjwani: That is true, ok then Iâm done, awesome, just gotta change the appearance 
Michael Lu: Good good 
Saif Punjwani: Thanks soo much ð, I did put some nuts and stuff in there, but ignore those 
Michael Lu: Lol itâs fine 
Saif Punjwani: Aight, thx sm :DDDDD 
Michael Lu: Yup np saif 
Saif Punjwani: Again sorry it was so late :D 
Michael Lu: Nah itâs fine XD 
Saif Punjwani: :P ;) :D

Saif Punjwani: suureeee And we lost finger lakes Hi congrats !! -shifa 


Conversation:
Saif Punjwani: Yo I tested out OBS and it works It saves it as a .flv so it would have to be converted But I am gonna put the test on CAD google drive and as long as you have a mic you could input audio I can show you how to add the displays and stuff Like next time we meet Or Iâll screen record how to add the displays and stuff and send it, also you can add an output audio function so the âclickâ noise when you mate can be heard And itâs free so itâs good, but we would just need to find a way to convert the files But we can just go on a file converter so it shouldnât be too big of a problem 
Michael Lu: Aight aight What converter would I use Lmk next time Thx said Saif* 


Conversation:
Saif Punjwani: Np, yeah I found an online file converter and I am gonna test if it works rn Hey did I miss anything?

Michael Lu: how does the hofstra trip owrk work* is it 3 days? 
Sam Go: wednesday only a select number will help set up in the evening (don't worry about this)
Thursday is a practice match day (only certain people as well, usually just the drive team and other captains) Friday and Saturday are competition days 
Michael Lu: i seeeeee 
Sam Go: those are the important ones 
Michael Lu: two competition days i see what time on friday 7 am? to 6 pm i seee also how do we get shirts 
Sam Go: Friday yeah ends up being the whole day, you miss school :D something like that and shirts i think theyll sort out this week, no idea what is happening with that 
Michael Lu: oke thx 
Sam Go: Do you know Saad's number by any chance? 
Michael Lu: nope sry is it possible to attend the hofstra trip only on saturday?

Michael Lu: lel did you guys ever use cRio or just roboRio? or do they have different functions? 
Sam Go: I believe the cRIO was the old version of the roboRIO the roboRIO was the only one we used this season 
Michael Lu: i see 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: are you coming tmrw? 
Sam Go: nope :( got plans 
Michael Lu: :( 
Sam Go: but feel free to ask us whatever 
Michael Lu: i think autodesk KOP released 
Sam Go: yep theres the step file on the bottom styaing on top of things, i like it 
Michael Lu: Do I create a new folder for KOP? 
Sam Go: i recommend it and when u guys use parts from there, just reference them directly from that same folder dont make compies - it makes too much clutter 
Michael Lu: K What do I do after import? What's the CAD process from here on? 
Sam Go: just leave em XD make sure they are extracted 
Michael Lu: Does the drive train come with the totes? 
Sam Go: not quite i think it might be a separate download 
Michael Lu: Where do u find the robo rip? Robo rio* 
Sam Go: kit if parts Sorry for extremely late reply 
Michael Lu: wasn't there :( 
Sam Go: U sure? The one I downloaded for SolidWorks had it so 
Michael Lu: was it in the yellow tote folder? 
Sam Go: Not sure, gonna get back to u when we get home 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: sam, are you good with motor physics? 
Sam Go: id say no, not really 
Michael Lu: k how much does motor torque matter to move something forward, if the motors hook up to a wheel 
Sam Go: if youre doing like a rc car or small thing like that it prob wont matter 
Michael Lu: yeah but it's a hoverboard :( 
Sam Go: oh shiz ok and someones gonna be on that i assume 
Michael Lu: yeah i need 300 - 500 rpm but the torque is abysmally low 
Sam Go: any reason why 300 - 500 rpm ? 
Michael Lu: unless my calculations are wrong oh wait, hold on i forgot to convert wheel inches to meters... stand by :) ok then 200 rpm? gah 10 inch wheels, goal speed of 2.7 mps good catch on the rpm mistake :) 
Sam Go: 10 in circum dia or radius XD 
Michael Lu: dia 
Sam Go: tbh that was all you with the mistake catch i was just asking if there was a justification for 300-500 rpm XD 
Michael Lu: lol 
Sam Go: those are big wheels :O 
Michael Lu: yeah, minimizes rpm needs bc finding good motors are annoying 
Sam Go: thats true, i had to work on a project during my 2nd semester and motors were a pain so 2.7 meters / s with 10 in wheels 
Michael Lu: yeah holy crap, just converting to inches to meters for the wheel makes a big RPM difference 
Sam Go: 2.7 meters is like 106 inches right 
Michael Lu: yeah 
Sam Go: jeez 6360 inches in a minute did i do that right 
Michael Lu: divide by 31.3? 31.415 
Sam Go: oh shoot wait u said diameter not circumfrerence 
Michael Lu: dia 
Sam Go: fml ok ok XD 
Michael Lu: XD same tho the units and math is a pain i got 200 ish rpm 
Sam Go: yeah if we didnt screw it up, thats what i got as well 
Michael Lu: okay, now the elusive is torque 
Sam Go: yep cuz its a tradeoff you might need a gearbox or something do you know how much is like a good amount torque 
Michael Lu: idk, i was hoping you would know some physics to help this guy used 300 rpm 30kgcm torque motors but those aren't available in the US 
Sam Go: well with a 10 inch wheel dia the motor attached at the eaxle axle your "lever" is  5 inches what im thinking is you need to overcome the static friction of someone standing on the hoverboard how many wheels? 
Michael Lu: 2 drive wheels, 2 motors, 1 swivel wheel for balance the scary part is that some amazon motors at less RPM don't even come close to the 30kgcm torque motors this guy has 
Sam Go: 30kgcm = about 3 Nm that means for a meter jeez 
Michael Lu: at least the RPM is lower than before expected, but the torque is the problem 
Sam Go: wheel material? 
Michael Lu: pneumatic rubber tire, plastic core 
Sam Go: aight so perhaps lets try some friction calculations, lets use metric um are you the only one riding this 
Michael Lu: maybe, but just assume 65 ish kg load 
Sam Go: aight so 65kg coeff of static friction for rubber an asphaltt is around .75 
Michael Lu: 0.75 * 65 * 9.8? 
Sam Go: so to overcome the static friction you need at least 477.5 Newtons yep ok so now lets see 5 inches to meters 
Michael Lu: 0.127 m 
Sam Go: aight so lets multiply those to get the torque 
Michael Lu: 60 Nm? 60.6 
Sam Go: hrm ok and lets say we use this motor the 2.2kgcm one .22 hrm :/ did i screw up some math here oh wait were in rotation i think its a different equation jeez 
Michael Lu: oh how would I get the efficiency? 
Sam Go: i dont even know XD i think it shouldnt be this complicated 
Michael Lu: hmm, so is the only purpose of motor torque to overcome friction? on flat ground? 
Sam Go: and then to accelerate you so it has to overcome it and exceed it 
Michael Lu: i see. 
Sam Go: if its a 3kgcm motor torque that means imagine u had a centimeter of a stick and a 3kg mass at one end thats how much twisting "force" the motor has imm convinced i did the frcition calcs rong because he used 3.3 right 
Michael Lu: yeah about 3 Nm 30 kgcm 
Sam Go: right ok hrm i used coeffecient of static friction i think we needed roling resistance a bike tire on concrete is about .002 F = CrrN force is coeff of rlling friction times normal force (weight of erson) but it shoul dbe div by two cuz its being split betweent he two wheels 
Michael Lu: does that apply for static friction too? splitting between two wheels? 
Sam Go: good question actually i take it back hrm i believe it shoudl apply too forget the wheels lets say lets just say you had a scale under u 2 scales rather one on each side where each wheel would be they both wont read 65kg (whatever that is in Newtons) it would read half of that 
Michael Lu: oh i see 
Sam Go: could be wrong, but something like that so divided by two give us .637 N to get the thing rolling how muchh torque is that multiply by radius 
Michael Lu: * 0.127 m = 0.080899? 
Sam Go: this  seems oddly small now hrm lets go on with it for now, at least its not a massive imposible number .081 Nm needed, eachh wheel the motor is rated at 2.2kgcm 
Michael Lu: that's like 0.825 kgcm... :O 
Sam Go: hrm maybe were ok 
Michael Lu: i hope that'd be great if torque required is that low 
Sam Go: usually we throw on a factor of safety of some sort if we say like just throw on a FoS of 2, wed like .825*2 which is 1.65 dude we might be ok i hope we did this right 
Michael Lu: what about static friction? does this mean i'd have to give it a rolling start before i turn the motors on? if torque is this low or is static friction just for non-circular objects? 
Sam Go: static i think is just for stuff sliding against each other so a box on a table 
Michael Lu: dammmmmmmm 
Sam Go: or if you start skidding on the hoverboard 
Michael Lu: that makes a lot more sense lol 
Sam Go: yeah. i mean technically i think theres stilll static friction in rolling but its more of ppreventing it from sliding the same way as the roll some weird technicallity like that phsyics junior year this comng year? 
Michael Lu: yep 
Sam Go: oh goodie well im glad you got a little head start XD 
Michael Lu: lol :) 
Sam Go: hopefully thhis helped a bit, i actually havent gotten really into motor stuff myself so i apologize if its wrong haha 
Michael Lu: it's okay, this was amazing :) really helped me out thanks man, appreciate it, this was actually really good for choosing parts 
Sam Go: if theyre the wrong motors, maybe you can return them. on the bright side, theyre not terribly expensive :D and yeah man, this was fun ! 
Michael Lu: yep :) thx 
Sam Go: if you need naything else, let me or josh know. josh might be better with the electrical stuff 
Michael Lu: Also, do you know how to calculate the linear acceleration of the load based on the motor? 
Sam Go: i would assume its just a conversion from rotational acceleration to linear not quite sure though because its not like constant angular acceleration 
Michael Lu: How do you do the conversion and how do you get rotational? 
Sam Go: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/15098/linear-acceleration-vs-angular-acceleration-equation this stuff wasnt my strong suit :P 
Michael Lu: Did I get the acceleration right? Seems too good to be true... 
Sam Go: hrmm that seem a bit to quick 
Michael Lu: Thought so 
Sam Go: not sure how to do this one man, sorry :( 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Hey Sam, so the hover board thingy has been coming along, but the motors aren't powerful enough to carry me. Will adding three swivel wheels help a lot? 
Sam Go: yo hey! glad to see some progress! where are these swivel wheels going 
Michael Lu: At the back mostly At the front if needed 
Sam Go: so not attached to the motors 
Michael Lu: But prefer not to 
Sam Go: just as an extra 
Michael Lu: Yeah just for balance and I guess to alleviate the weight 
Sam Go: its hard to say, itll probably be time consuming to attach them but if you plann it well and are able to take it off and on quickly enough then it might be worth trying it :P 
Michael Lu: Okey 
Sam Go: let me know how that goes 
Michael Lu: Will it put less stress on the motors and improve performance? 
Sam Go: if it really is less stress, then yes question becomes is it less stress XD which we'll find out by the extra wheels :P 
Michael Lu: I guess it's worth the try 
Sam Go: do the motors feel powerful like if u used ur hands to push ont he board can it move 
Michael Lu: I haven't tried that yet, but the motors can move the board by itself (at full pwmï¼ 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: New motors at 1/3 speed 
Sam Go: looking goood 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: In your opinion: SolidWorks or Autodesk Inventor? 
Sam Go: Solidworks 
Michael Lu: Is it easier to use/learn? Or is it a functionality thing? 
Sam Go: personally think so (both) and its industry standard 
Michael Lu: Was it easy for you to learn? Like is it similar to Autodesk when you use it for the first time? 
Sam Go: after using inventor for 2630 the switch to solidworks was not bad at all 2638* wow i forgot our team number?!? 
Michael Lu: :o 
Sam Go: hows detroit treaiting you guys?? 
Michael Lu: Okay weâre actually going home early right now because we didnât make playofffs So SolidWorks still has sketches and constraints similar to Autodesk? I talked to some other teams, and they say SolidWorks is simpler somehow. 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Hey Sam! So, I am in the college grind this year (stressful af) Looking into Cornell Engineering rn Any tips for writing essays (common app and supplement for Cornell engineering)? Do you mind sharing what you wrote your supplement about? If not thatâs ok Thanks GoBro! 
Sam Go: Ill take a look when I get home about what I have! 
Michael Lu: K thankssss! Also, just wondering what Cornellâs relationship with Ithaca is like Do u guys do a lot of community work with Ithaca? Especially with respect to engineering? 
Sam Go: Aight sorry haven't gotten back to you, been running errands and doing family things haha!

So to answer latest question: 
I can't say super much about what kind of community work (engineering related) that we do with Ithaca but I do know there are a couple programs and classes that help the local community. Not so much on the engineering side to the extent of my knowledge.

As for the supplement and essays:
I'm gonna be honest I don't think any student actually has great tips for this, myself included. 

For common app, I did something about personal development and working with people.

For supplement, they asked about interest in engineering. So I wrote briefly about what I've done engineering related, then link it to Cornell. Show them you have a plan (even if you don't actually follow the plan lol) - for instance, that you want to join (organizations/teams/etc) and take advantage of ____ opportunities and how this will all help to launch a career in engineering. Hope that was helpful! 
Michael Lu: K got it thx Sam!

Michael Lu: lol good 
Sam Levine: only one i stumbled on and improvised was he asked how do you know the point mutations caused will turn the worm male instead of hermaphrodte and influence gender diversity and i was like uhh shit well all you need is one male and then ratio will shoot up next generation because when male mates with hermaphorite intstead of selfing produces 1:1 ratio of male to h with more eggs produced so next gen will have significant difference and survived that

Michael Lu: it happens yeah my computer is fixed i replaced the psu 
Sam Levine: Hue I think it's because I kept getting stuck in tier 5 matches with my pz1c with the 13mm mg Which kicks ass in top tier And is my clubbing machine of choice But can't pen shit at bottom tier And turns too slowly to scout And can't passive scout for shit either I need a new stat padding tank

Sam Levine: I just realized Why do I care about stats Win rate and wn8 aren't indicative of skill till about 1.5-2k battles Because with like only 500 battles A losing streak will screw up your win rate and wn8 by about 1-2% At this point I'm honestly scared of the 13 75 because apparently it sucks All of the lines I'm grinding the tier 7s are abysmal except for German tds Fuck that French lights have been power creeped to shit apparently Time to move that line to my secondary list But I mean idk if I'm gonna keep playing wot I mean there's sunk cost fallacy That's it pretty much Because the power creep sucks The m41 walker bullshit outclasses all the other t7 lights Same with all the other lines And offc the new lines that they add will be total power creep Guess I'll just play wargame red dragon Idk Guess I call German lights Because tho sp1c is crap, ru 251 and leopard are good Actually fuck etiquette I'm gonna do murican lights Because they power creeped the shit out of French lights Even though the t37 is meh Doesn't matter because you're still ahead of me on that line if you're still grinding it Guess I'll seriously grind French over summer Murican lights tho I don't fucking know what to do the power creep is real 
Michael Lu: they have good pen but no armor and i don't know if i wanna continue merican lights going soviet 
Sam Levine: I don't mind no armor I'll take Merica you take Soviet Hue the lttb Because tis true. The elc has better armor than some of the American lights But the lttb/t54 ltwt doe The t54 lt is a better medium than the t44 I went to the Lincoln center chamber performance Our ensembles were second and third to last From our school And they were good But then we got overshadowed by laguardia because they were last and good

Sam Levine: The loop hole is that after your second skill hits around 10-20 percent, retrain at 90% for credits and select sixth sense as first, so you essentially just need some credits and 1 trained skill and a 25-35% trained second You have red orchestra right Just go on a populated server using voice chat Set your profile name to a presidential candidate And get 3-4 teamkills At the end of the match You'll see

After years of oppression, we donât have a choice
We must pick a man worthy to take our voice
Since Bernie dropped out, letâs take choice two
His first name Daniel, his last name Lu
*CHORUS*
Daniel Lu: Dictator for you!
A vote for Daniel is a vote for you!
He may be tall, but he can pack a punch
Heâll enslave all the north kids at once
*VERSE 2*
We want Lu, the next revolution
If we donât get him, there will be no solution
This is the campaign thatâll change ur lives
Lets let Daniel Lu be the one who survives
*CHORUS*
*VERSE 3*
Daniel Lu is Chinese like many others
Let him rally our asian brothers
Wait, thereâs one Asian country on the map
That Daniel doesnât like-theyâre filthy Japs
*CHORUS* 
Michael Lu: hahahaha lmao 


Conversation:
Sam Levine: I sexually identify as the FitnessGram Pacer Test. Ever since I was a kid I dreamed of being an multi stage aerobic capacity test that progressively get more difficult as it continues. People tell me that a person canÂ´t be a school fitness test but I donÂ´t care, IÂ´m beautiful. Every morning I wake up and tell myself "The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds". My running speed starts slowly but gets faster every minute. In school, every time I hear the bell I think "A single lap should've been completed, and if It isn't completed twice the test is over". From now on I want you guys to call me Fitness Gram and respect my right to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. If you can't accept that I am a aerobic capacity test then you're a testophobe and you need to check your running privelage. Thank you for being so understanding 
Michael Lu: :| 
Sam Levine: I sexually identify as Marco Rubio. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of dispelling with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. People say to me that a person being Marco Rubio is impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I don't care, I'm dispelling with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. I'm having a surgeon install the ability to dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what's doing, and the ability to know exactly what he's doing. From now on I want you guys to call me "President" and respect my right to dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. If you can't accept me you're trying to change this country and need to check your Chris Christie privilege. Thank you for being so understanding that I'm dispelling with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing.

Michael Lu: wat daniel says u got an 89 on Ko. 
Sam Levine: he refused to gib points back lemme explain more so I fucked up the answer sheet by moving some over because I was rushed that was the 74 then I went after school to clarify and got my exam back it was higher than 93 that I estimated based off of answer sheet mistakes according to question sheet and scantron it was 95 I told Ko and showed him my answers he didn't want to give me back full points because I botched answer sheet but he gave back stacks of two or more for the Cs that I put as Ds so my average wouldn't be permanently fucked unfortunately he didn't gib back the rest of the questions that I got right so rip time to study for next test 
Michael Lu: so you would have gotten a 95? 
Sam Levine: ye do you understand 
Michael Lu: dayummmm 
Sam Levine: how pissed off I am right now 
Michael Lu: ye 
Sam Levine: k 
Michael Lu: who got the 73 ffs 73/79 we were really close to dominating the top scores in the class 
Sam Levine: idk probably trinity or someone fuck I wanted to set the curve 
Michael Lu: that's our goal to have the nerds dominate the top scores every test 
Sam Levine: heheh 
Michael Lu: the only way we can acquire power 
Sam Levine: over jew holidays imma work on bogus study guide and make a serious subtly wrong one 
Michael Lu: and now kids know richard got one of the 95's so people gonna be pretty pissed 
Sam Levine: ye richard studied really hard for it apparently 
Michael Lu: ???? u kidding me he plays games in class 
Sam Levine: I thought richard was a dumbas 
Michael Lu: richard skipped grade 
Sam Levine: yeah

Sam Levine: richard studies a lot out of school does no extracurriculars that's a major component If I didn't fkn waste 2-4 hours a day playing instrument I could do like 3 outlines a day I have blum test on thursday so ain't gonna study then 
Michael Lu: rip 
Sam Levine: on like chapter 15 because he just rushes through it and expects you to get it first time through rubin I've heard is opposite 
Michael Lu: ye painfully slow 
Sam Levine: ye better than blum 
Michael Lu: tests occur once in a blue moon 
Sam Levine: as long as you finish by end of school year at least if you pull an 85+ average in blum's class the SATII is apparently a joke I get through Blum's class by remembering that that's pretty much college in a nutshell professor lectures you are expected to learn it mostly on your own chugh kurlander is not that bad I just don't listen the stuff is easy enough to self study get on skype and meet rylee

Conversation:
Sam Levine: *6 DEGREES UNDER*
At age 18, Daniel was drafted into the Marine Corps straight out of Cornell university to fight in the battle of Hong Kong post South China Sea campaign. Daniel, being native Chinese, struggled with the idea of fighting his countrymen, and after his return to society with 3 confirmed kills to his name, had to deal with the fear of readjusting to society after being frowned upon by both his american and chinese brethren. Wracked by PTSD and alcoholism, he wrote a book, entitled âSix Degrees Underâ about his experiences in the war. The film adaptation, directed by Wes Anderson and Starring Ki Hong Lee as Lu, is being hailed by the New York Times as a âstunning, gritty portrayal of the horror that is war, and the ethical consequences of traitorous feelingsâ
*SUMMARY*
Daniel is shown sitting in his dorm, staring at a piece of paper. He begins narrating, explaining that he was drafted into the Marines 4 months after his 18th birthday. We see Daniel hugging his girlfriend and she says something about loving him forever. It cuts to recruits disembarking from a bus into Parris Island. A montage begins, narrated about his experiences in training. We see Daniel failing miserably on the fitness examination and getting screamed at by a Drill Instructor. Daniel slowly but surely improves and scores Expert Marksman. Due to his academic background, he goes into MOS 0621: Field Radio Operator. After completing infantry school, he is shown with musical montage at Twentynine Palms in live fire exercises. In one, his friend from basic is killed due to a radio miscommunication resulting in an off target strafing run. Daniel is first given leave in South Korea where he joins the fleet and meets his squad mates. Daniel lands in the first wave off the 6 lane highway leading to Hong Kong. There is no resistance on the beach which Daniel takes note of. Due to the constant bombardment, the highway is filled with the hulks of destroyed civilian vehicles and the rotting smell of bodies lies with them for days as they advance on Hong Kong. When they reach the outskirts of the city, they are reinforced with armor. Daniel and his squad do not see the enemy until reaching a hotel in the city center. There, a massive firefight occurs, with the Platoon commander and medic along with several grunts being killed. Daniel pushes into the building and fires a burst into a surrendering chinese soldier. Daniel bleakly narrates that he and his comrades had been drilled into hate since the first days of boot camp. He and the remnants of his platoon advance into the hotel after Daniel calls in an airstrike on the upper floors of the building. They engage in brutal close quarter combat moving up floor by floor. Daniel kicks in doors and clears a room, killing two and taking 5 prisoner. Due to his actions in advancing up the hotel, Daniel is nominated for a navy cross by his CO, the defacto platoon commander. After reaching the massive hole blown in the structure by the F/A 18 bomb, they are taken on picture by a helicopter camera crew flying by. While standing on the edge, Daniel contemplates jumping. An imbedded correspondent takes a picture of his thousand yard stare and it is displayed on the cover of time entitled âWhat are we fighting for?â. After several more combat actions, Daniel is wounded in an engagement with a sniper. He is honorably discharged but denied his Navy Cross. Daniel goes home facing the demons of his past and knowing that he killed his countrymen. After intentionally ditching the victory parade, he goes back to Cornell to find out that his girlfriend ditched him for a rich frat brother that dodged the draft. Daniel nearly beats the guy to death and is held in prison overnight. He fails out of Cornell and is struggling to hold a job anywhere. After struggling with severe PTSD and alcoholism, he decides to put himself at peace by writing a memoir on his experiences. The movie ends with a cut to black and Daniel stating that âHe never returned to himself after his soul left in Hong Kongâ. 
Michael Lu: ffs world scores out lol daniel got the high score 
Sam Levine: yep 99.7 is it gonna be a whole year of daniel reking shit 
Michael Lu: wat u get 
Sam Levine: meanwhile I have my 93.5 or some shit 
Michael Lu: dammit nobody made top 3 except daniel 
Sam Levine: what did you get 
Michael Lu: 94.17 meanwhile, daniel is accusing me of apathy somehow 
Sam Levine: isn't that top 3 lemme check 
Michael Lu: no i was 1 raw point off 
Sam Levine: oh I think I'm gonna do all my studying and cheat sheets for this coming exam over weekend gotta make first once this is fucking shameful also once we get more modern, I will start doing better like out of these shitty units that everyone knows already THIS IS FUCKING AWFUL time to stop making excuses and start studying jesus what sorcery is this how does daniel do so well 
Michael Lu: history buff power 
Sam Levine: true 
Michael Lu: and he reads a lot of articles/documents 
Sam Levine: he actually knows about the time period 
Michael Lu: so he is good at dbq 
Sam Levine: true true 
Michael Lu: and not to discredit his intrinsic intellectual ability which is above average, no doubt 
Sam Levine: above average 
Michael Lu: you can't be top scorer in AP World by being a scrub that's why try hards fail 
Sam Levine: who were other top 2 people then 
Michael Lu: idk probably anderson nick idk maybe a lucky tryhard 
Sam Levine: could be thing is at a certain point it comes down to who guessed correctly on certain questinos 
Michael Lu: in some cases yes 
Sam Levine: like in the +- 2 raw points threshold 
Michael Lu: perhaps yes 
Sam Levine: I'm not degrading daniel he got a good 7 points higher on raw score 
Michael Lu: btw daniel is mad that people only see him as a history buff 
Sam Levine: yeah he told me but what else does he do not known as a musician 
Michael Lu: either he's just being modest 
Sam Levine: no he was legitimately upset 
Michael Lu: or he is legitimately salty 
Sam Levine: I was tlaking in person he doesn't like being known for only history buff because they are dime a dozen 
Michael Lu: well, what does he expect if he scores top on soc test and spends his life dressing up as commies, singing historical marches, and talking about politics, current events, etc 
Sam Levine: yeah pretty much he does ok in other subjects but not exceptionally 
Michael Lu: tbh, i have no idea why he is complaining 
Sam Levine: it's better than my situation 
Michael Lu: still exceptional, but not EXCEPTIONAL 
Sam Levine: where I underachieve so fucking much in history and music in quiz bowl I do well but that is just matter of reading and gradually memorizing super nitty gritty stuff since childhood that's true though he reads ton of articles and documents other than books 
Michael Lu: yes ik 
Sam Levine: eh well whateber back to studying

After years of oppression, we donât have a choice
We must pick a man worthy to take our voice
Since Bernie dropped out, letâs take choice two
His first name Daniel, his last name Lu
*CHORUS*
Daniel Lu: Dictator for you!
A vote for Daniel is a vote for you!
He may be tall, but he can pack a punch
Heâll enslave all the north kids at once
Daniel Lu heâll fight for you
Heâll make south great again for all of you
Daniel Lu heâll get the job done
Even while fucking Stephanie Cheung
*VERSE 2*
We want Lu, the next revolution
If we donât get him, there will be no solution
This is the campaign thatâll change ur lives
Lets let Daniel Lu be the one who survives
*CHORUS*
*VERSE 3*
Daniel Lu is Chinese like many others
Let him rally our asian brothers
Wait, thereâs one Asian country on the map
That Daniel doesnât like-theyâre filthy Japs
*CHORUS*
*VERSE 4*
Daniel Lu is a true magician
He leads the people against the patricians
Heâs such a $tud that in a late night fling
Daniel ended up banging Michelle Xing
*CHORUS*
*VERSE 5*
Daniel Lu, heâs an academic genius
His intellect only rivaled by the length of his penis
He always sets the curve in the class of Ko
His dick is what Cheryl really did blow
*CHORUS*
*VERSE 6*
Daniel Lu is a true commie
Heâll get stuff done through government lobbies
He also likes Cheryl, sheâs such a hottie
Vote Lu to represent the student body
*CHORUS*
*VERSE 7*
Daniel Lu the Kaifeng Jew
His dick is what Cheryl and Stephanie blew
Heâs a true leader, fighting for you
Vote for Lu, and heâll blow you too.
*CHORUS*
*VERSE 8*
Daniel Lu is a goddamn wizard
He even revealed crooked Hillary to be a lizard
Lu is such a boss that he keeps chomping at the bit
He even managed to make Zoe Sheill feel like shit
*CHORUS*
_Daniel Lu will dab for you_ (6x dying out)

This tonic of the key of Prelude and Fugue No. 11 in "The Well Tempered Clavier" is, represented by a letter, the last of the second syllable in the name of Erwin Rommel's personal chauffeur.

Fighting at St. Julien and Kitcheners' Wood occurred around this city in the first battles in which a Canadian force defeated a European power. The goal of the Lys offensive was the capture of this city, which was the location of the final battle of the Race to the (*) Sea as trenches were dug in 1914. The third battle named for this city is also named for a town five miles to its east called Passchendaele. The second battle for this city marked the first widespread use of poison gas during World War I. For 10 points, name this Belgian city that the British nicknamed "Wipers."

I really regret all my actions and every single word that I've uttered that contributed to this. I'm sorry for all the damage I have done. It hurts to know that the texts I've sent cannot be taken back. That the words I've spoken cannot be undone. I cannot change what has been done but I can and I will change what will be done. I hope I can lead by example to change my attitude and behavior and I believe that when we all join in to do this, the wounds can be healed and the broken pieces can be put back together, returning this club back to its whole and perfect form.

Sammy Katzman: Oh fuck now I get it that was too clever Do you want to know what my AI did or do you want tips on how to make one 
Michael Lu: Both 
Sammy Katzman: What mine did was shuffle between two different things, and every 50 turns I would check to see if I won more than I'd lost, if I did then I'd keep going, if not then I'd randomize the two things I was throwing As far as how to make one, just come up with a cool way to throw throws that beat the opponent, like what weisswange did was have a 5D array, the first 4 dimensions were his and your throw two turns ago, his and your throw last turn, and the 5th would be the amount of times each of your succeeding throws, and his return would be to beat that throw He kicked major ass with it 
Michael Lu: I heard he used markov or something Pretty smart dude Where did he go? Like Princeton? XD 
Sammy Katzman: Yeah weisswange's great He went to school to be a mechanical engineer Which is also hilarious

Michael Lu: train and validation are tuples where the first tuple element is all the data and the second tuple element is all the labels since it's all gray scale, the pixel values go from 0 - 255, so just divide all the data (train[0]) by the max possible value which is 255 to scale it between 0 a nd 1 
Sarah Chieng: is that the same question? 
Michael Lu: no just look at the second and third lines of code 
Sarah Chieng: but what do you do about the layers

Conversation:
Sharon Lam: hey litty 
Michael Lu: hey sharone 
Sharon Lam: can u help me with a physics question ð© 
Michael Lu: No Yes witch one 
Sharon Lam: part b idg why it aint 300 
Michael Lu: You canât just add up speeds to get avg speed Like If I run 1200 meters at usain bolt pace And then 2 meters at turtle pace By adding up speeds and dividing by two ainât fair U get me? 
Sharon Lam: uh huh 
Michael Lu: Because I ran so much more at usain bolt pace (ik Iâm fast ð) It needs more wait Weight* In the avg 
Sharon Lam: oh right right 
Michael Lu: So average velocity really relies on distance and time 
Sharon Lam: still not sure how to solve this :/ 
Michael Lu: So the duck traveled 800 m First 800 m At 200 km/h So then you get his 800 split (ofc slower than my usain bolt pace) 
Sharon Lam: so 200= 800/t?? 
Michael Lu: Then you know his second 800 time by subtracting from total time Convert 200 km/h to m/s Yeah then solve for t Should be like 55.55555 = 800/t 
Sharon Lam: TYSM i forgot to change the answer back to km/h so i was confused but i then i realized lol 
Michael Lu: Np sharen

Conversation:
Michael Lu: Whatâs the diff between selenium and beautiful soup If I want to make a scraper that collects data on fb/linked in friends Would I have to use both and how much of each would I have to use And are both in python? 
Shawn Chao: Lemme get back to you on this Gotta do something rn So the difference between beautifulsoup (bs4) and selenium especially in the way i use it is that bs4 takes data from the html code while selenium relies on the xcode to perform actions i use selenium to scroll, click on stuff, type I use beautiful soup to fetch data from the webpage Yeah both are in Python I use both to compliment each other sometimes Also I have a Facebook scraper 
Michael Lu: is that solely in bs4? 
Shawn Chao: To scrape your friends list and get their Facebook url nah partially selenium 
Michael Lu: for what 
Shawn Chao: for Facebook your personal Facebook it auto logins for you too 
Michael Lu: i mean like what do you use selenium for in that project oh 
Shawn Chao: To login, click on stuff, scroll etc. 
Michael Lu: because bs4 can't access the friends page without you logging in with selenium? 
Shawn Chao: yes thats why you need selenium I can send you my repo 
Michael Lu: that'd be dope thx mna 
Shawn Chao: https://github.com/sschao/Facebook-Friends-Analysis i also have code that scrapes which college the person goes to 
Michael Lu: wait can u send that too 
Shawn Chao: yeah its on my old computer I will send that over when i get back 
Michael Lu: how long does it take for one of these fb scrapers to run 
Shawn Chao: its bit buggier and might get you temp banned 
Michael Lu: since you have to time out 
Shawn Chao: The first one is quite fast. Like less than 10 minutes Because bs4 doesnt send a request each time it fetches It only sends one request and gets the html the scraping for colleges one takes a long time might take you a week and with the possibility of getting FB disabled Messenger and FB mobile will still be fine though so honestly that big of a deal 
Michael Lu: why did you use a scraper instead of the Facebook API? 
Shawn Chao: I think Facebook API has been disabled? 
Michael Lu: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/user/ 
Shawn Chao: can it look for the number of mutual friends this is only a graph right 
Michael Lu: i think so not to osure 
Shawn Chao: i didnt look too much into it. I was using this as a proof of concept 
Michael Lu: aight 
Shawn Chao: This might be a downside too "Represents a collection of Users who are friends of the app User. Only friends who have installed the app and who have granted the app the user_friends permission will be included." for the api some dont have FB app 
Michael Lu: like the mbile app? 
Shawn Chao: i think thats what this means 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: does selenium send a ping to facebook everytime a driver method is used? for instance, everytime i look for an element in selenium or try to pull html data from the page with the selenium driver method, does it send a request to fb? 
Shawn Chao: I think only if you perform an action it does Not completely sure though 
Michael Lu: most of my scraper is selenium code rn not soup code idk 
Shawn Chao: Yeah I think that is probably ok 
Michael Lu: aigh aight

Shawn Chao: Where did the plurality of students from gns go to 
Michael Lu: Not in the town thatâs attended a lot State schools like Stony Brook and Binghamton Which are I guess an hour and a few hours away respectively Not too sure but itâs definitely too big of a town

Michael Lu: Cindy or Mccalla Yeah side projects and interesting extracurriculars/work experience 
Shawn Chao: Mccalla Oh bc you were subcontracted right So you were a pretty good coder 
Michael Lu: One contract one internship Well I think This was back when coding before college was MUCH less saturated So probably less so my aptitude as much as the fact that I knew how to code in several languages 
Shawn Chao: True! Well I guess less saturated for swe right Usaco was quite saturated 
Michael Lu: So Usaco At least in high school I feel like wonât necessarily get u hired 
Shawn Chao: Jw did you find it hard to learn new languages? Most are fairly easy to learn if you know 1 right? Yeah that's prolly fair depending on the job. Although I would argue that for FB and Google usaco is actually more useful bc of leetcode questions 
Michael Lu: No especially since I started with JavaScript, which is middle of the road making python easy to pick up and java (and other C languages) werenât too hard to learn Yeah true I think that most companies if they would hire a high schooler are looking for having enough skills to be useful, whereas usaco ur probably learning abstract CS fundamentals with one language only 
Shawn Chao: Interesting Yeah I feel like hs students would be just for immediate value While college students are an investment 
Michael Lu: Yeah high schoolers are unreliable hires too 
Shawn Chao: True Lol What type of company did you work for 
Michael Lu: Product design startup

Michael Lu: Have u done -8.03 18.03 
Shreya Gupta: Everything but #2 Which I don't get (but also I gave up p quickly lol) 
Michael Lu: Yeah Iâm stuck on 2 
Shreya Gupta: Lemme look at it again It says V is 2 dimensional Oh wait 
Michael Lu: is it asking for like a linear combo y1 = cy2 + cy3? 
Shreya Gupta: yeah I think so 
Michael Lu: was like 
Shreya Gupta: ohhb wait hold up 
Michael Lu: coordinates mentioned in lecture 
Shreya Gupta: Yeah Uhm Can I call you real quick? 
Michael Lu: ok 
Shreya Gupta: Wait nvm figured it out Was being dumb 
Michael Lu: o? 
Shreya Gupta: It's p simple from there lol The rest of the pset took me like 20 min so you're chillin 
Michael Lu: dope dope do you have to solve for a and b in ur linear combo 
Shreya Gupta: Yuh 
Michael Lu: is it solvable What were ur solutions to 4 
Shreya Gupta: Yeah, just make. A system of equations 
Michael Lu: Oh f I used the wrong sign for every trace Can u share 1, 2, 3 
Shreya Gupta: Oh nooo Tada 
Michael Lu: For 4 I donât get how u got the values for the vector solutions Also isnât it A - eigenvalue identity matrix Not the other way around Wait Maybe not Wait Maybe 
Shreya Gupta: Uhm I don't think so 
Michael Lu: The values on the diagonal are opposite sign of the eigenvalue ? 
Shreya Gupta: hmmm do you get the same numbers? 
Michael Lu: Oh disregard the second one I havenât updated 
Shreya Gupta: F Wait It's the same Mmm wait no Yours is sideways too? 
Michael Lu: Same just flipped Signs But how do u find The unknown 
Shreya Gupta: oh jk jk Lambda? 
Michael Lu: Did u guess? The vector values 
Shreya Gupta: you can set up a system Yeah It's any # and it's negative 
Michael Lu: Lol so U put down 3 and -2 for one 
Shreya Gupta: Yeah 
Michael Lu: Arenât those different nUmbers 
Shreya Gupta: That's for a different matrix tho 
Michael Lu: How does v1 have 3 and -2 3 is not the negative of 2? Wait Disregard Flipped Disregard 
Shreya Gupta: ??? 
Michael Lu: I read the wrong solutions for the wrong matrix Because I solved in a diffeeeent order 
Shreya Gupta: Ah okay I was so confused 
Michael Lu: Also how to do 1v 1b 
Shreya Gupta: not diagonalizable if it has 1 eiegenval 
Michael Lu: Donât u get that at c= -4 and c=8 Oh so itâs diagnosable When itâs not -4 and 8! ? Whatâs c element of C 
Shreya Gupta: Yeah ? c is any complex number That's not -4 and 8 
Michael Lu: Oh interesting 
Shreya Gupta: Prob could have written that better 
Michael Lu: No ur fine Iâm just unaware of that notations okeee thx for help!!!! gonna make a gc 
Shreya Gupta: :))) 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Is the 042 lecture up? Lecture 12? Also pls Chyekkk 
Shreya Gupta: Am doing 009 Will check later I'll look at it tomorrow bc am kindof dead rn Graphs B and C are isomorphic 4c might not cover all cases/explain why n/2 maximizes Your proof for 5b is wrong 
Michael Lu: What r the cases What did u say Oh, two three cycles that share an edge/two vertices? 
Shreya Gupta: You need to prove you can't 3 color Yee I think you can just explain why n/2 maximizes 
Michael Lu: Wait lol this doesnât work 
Shreya Gupta: two three cycles that share an edge and a separate vertex 
Michael Lu: What separate vertex 
Shreya Gupta: one sec 
Michael Lu: Okeee thx 
Shreya Gupta: welc 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Maaaaaaaaâaaaaamm Do u know how to do 6A 18.03 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: (Problem 1) 
Shreya Gupta: Ah I did not see this sorry And no, I'm at 4/5 attempts And I do not know :'( 
Michael Lu: dam wait waht have u tried so far 
Shreya Gupta: Uhm I think I tried all of them Wait lemme pull it up I unfortunately did not keep track 
Michael Lu: same 
Shreya Gupta: The last one I tried was everything but 3 and 4 
Michael Lu: aight aight 
Shreya Gupta: 1 and 2 are def true right? 
Michael Lu: yeh should be idk if "a solution" means it is the only solution or one of two solutions or more 
Shreya Gupta: Right Hmm 
Michael Lu: i have 2 tries so i will guesssss 
Shreya Gupta: Okay wait No Hold up So this is c1 = 1 c2 = 0 
Michael Lu: yeah i think thta's what it means 
Shreya Gupta: We don't know that the system is stable right 
Michael Lu: i don't think we can say anything about the phase portrait 
Shreya Gupta: Bc what if the other solution is like e^7t 
Michael Lu: yeah unless we can like backsolve to get A 
Shreya Gupta: I don't think so? 
Michael Lu: ur right prob not 
Shreya Gupta: Is it 123? Idk if 3 is true 
Michael Lu: yeah ima guess that wait it should be right oh wait no if it's a saddle tho 
Shreya Gupta: That solution is still a straight line tho right? Wait lemme look 
Michael Lu: the vectors are always straight 
Shreya Gupta: Yeah it's just a ray 
Michael Lu: but the diffeq is a curve 
Shreya Gupta: ? 
Michael Lu: lol hmm has cameron done it yet 
Shreya Gupta: Imma just ask the chat Appreciate the tear reacc 
Michael Lu: F 
Shreya Gupta: F I'm sure someone will figure it out by Friday

Michael Lu: Would u like to Czech later Ahahahhsjsjsjjdjd Dw 6.009 quiz isnât too bad 
Shreya Gupta: AM SMOOTH BRAIN 
Michael Lu: And test corrections very nice for 6.009 
Shreya Gupta: It's only 25% tho 
Michael Lu: Was also smooth brain, but test corrections ð 
Shreya Gupta: Bro IAP was the first time I coded in python And honestly the first time I coded seriously Am _very_ smooth brain

Michael Lu: ð 
Shreya Gupta: ð£ Yeah I'm genuinely worried about passing 009 
Michael Lu: Waittttr Do u do all the labs? Isnât 60% labs 
Shreya Gupta: Yeah... 
Michael Lu: Youâll definitely pass I did like not so great ont he quizzes last semester 
Shreya Gupta: It's 50% labs 
Michael Lu: But tests corrections and did all the labs Lol well letâs say you get the full 50% for labs And worst case You get 0 on quizzes but do test corrections for 25% Thatâs 75% pass :D

Michael Lu: completely BSed Q3 
Shreya Gupta: hello! 
Michael Lu: Hulaoaoskskspala 
Shreya Gupta: I finally finished things so we can cheqk 
Michael Lu: Stupendous 
Shreya Gupta: for 1c I started with "There is a partial order if a relation is always asymmetric, irreflexive, and transitive for allvertices  in  a  graph." 
Michael Lu: Oke 
Shreya Gupta: i feel like it's fine 
Michael Lu: Yeah thatâs fine 
Shreya Gupta: pnr? 
Michael Lu: Itâs a definition Is the rest of 1 okay Did u get beats is always asymmetric, never reflexive, always or reflexive, and sometimes transitive? 
Shreya Gupta: I got what you got 
Michael Lu: Yay What abt 2 2b is 37? 2c is 39? 
Shreya Gupta: I am chequing I will let you know if anything is different 
Michael Lu: Chyeccccccc yes maâam I can check 18.03 while u check 6.042 
Shreya Gupta: for 2d you might have to explain how you're sure this is the fastest way 
Michael Lu: It doesnât say explain tho 
Shreya Gupta: bro wtf are you doing with 3b 
Michael Lu: ð no idea 
Shreya Gupta: on piazza srini says you have to reasonably show that it's the fastest 
Michael Lu: Oooooh Oof Oke 
Shreya Gupta: also yeah lemme grab my 18.03 I think 
Michael Lu: It is 41 days tho right 
Shreya Gupta: you can checgk piazza why tf is it upside down apologies they are not sending in a good direction this is my 3b it is smol 042 looks good except I didn't do induction lol also I gotta go eat dinner so goodbye for now 
Michael Lu: Idk how to do 2b for 180.3 lol Nvm Wait I still didnât do Pset 6A question 1 lmao 
Shreya Gupta: Ms neither *me Everything good for 18.03? Also no one replied to the bumpppp 
Michael Lu: Yep all good Yeah this is quite sad normally I wouldnât care But I feel like if I donât get the answer o would have wasted all this time Making educated guesses lol 
Shreya Gupta: Edgy

Shreya Gupta: das me!!! do 2a6 with me!!! or maybe 2Anano 
Michael Lu: Lol 37 min to change 
Shreya Gupta: p sure it was due at 5 est but k 
Michael Lu: I declared 6-2 tho 
Shreya Gupta: :'( 
Michael Lu: Because mechE classes For 2A6 looked meh to me Like Thermo? Fluids? 
Shreya Gupta: I mean, it's a requirement for mechE like that's how mechE be 
Michael Lu: True true 
Shreya Gupta: idk I might go 2Anano or just more intense 2 so that stuffs gonna be useful idk I honestly have no idea 
Michael Lu: I mean what do u want to do In life maâam 
Shreya Gupta: my mom is like "why are you not just doing 6?????" 
Michael Lu: Idk thatâs a loaded question :/ 
Shreya Gupta: indeed 
Michael Lu: So I feel like job opportunities as mechE are big range from meh to cool Whereas CS is small range but between meh and cool 
Shreya Gupta: huh really also you said but but then you said the same thing after am confused _the range of both your sets is equivalent_ 
Michael Lu: Wat Ones meh - cool Other is like the midpoint I guess 
Shreya Gupta: huh 
Michael Lu: Between meaning midpoint whoops Like if u do CS ur guaranteed desk job and bashing keyboard computer Yesssss 
Shreya Gupta: I really busted out ms paint for you sir 
Michael Lu: Apprec8 Like if ur mechE Since the degree is inherently like not specialized and very broad 
Shreya Gupta: accur8 data only 
Michael Lu: U can do a lot 
Shreya Gupta: wait really, I would say CS is more versatile like esp these days 
Michael Lu: In terms of work environment no 
Shreya Gupta: ah okay that's very fair 
Michael Lu: I guess in terms of actual work u do yes I suppose good point Actually true 
Shreya Gupta: right like with a CS degree you can go work for pharma, or finance, or academia, or big tech 
Michael Lu: True 
Shreya Gupta: but no robots so boo 
Michael Lu: I guess I meant u always work at desk :/ big sad We like robot ð¤ 
Shreya Gupta: we do dude whenever I search up robot REBEL ROBOTICS pops up in my autocomplete 
Michael Lu: Omg lollll Ew Tho 
Shreya Gupta: and I'm v amused every time 
Michael Lu: u did vex right? 
Shreya Gupta: no excuse me ew no sir I am disappointed 
Michael Lu: U did FIRST? Or none 
Shreya Gupta: first lol 
Michael Lu: Yayyy 
Shreya Gupta: the cult 
Michael Lu: Were u big Texas energy and sponsored by NASA 
Shreya Gupta: lmao no, that's just one team in houston 118 =___= their robot is literally an official government vehicle so they have to get a bunch of papers signed before they move it anywhere 
Michael Lu: Thatsss true o so Lmao ð 
Shreya Gupta: dude I wonder if any of them are at the tvte 
Michael Lu: Yee 
Shreya Gupta: they are? or you wonder too? 
Michael Lu: Whatâs tvte 
Shreya Gupta: the institvte 
Michael Lu: o prob *casually gets rec from NASA engineer* 
Shreya Gupta: _casually_ lmao apparently my HS PI is like significantly  more well known than I knew about and now I'm 90% sure that's what got me in like 99% sure 
Michael Lu: Who dat 
Shreya Gupta: my lab pi 
Michael Lu: Who 
Shreya Gupta: oh andrew ellington 
Michael Lu: Famous? 
Shreya Gupta: like my lab PI was like ?!?!?!? *at MIT and this lab tech from our lab was considering his lab and a lab from caltech and she was actually thinking about it I was not aware of this 
Michael Lu: O interesting 
Shreya Gupta: ik it was strange worlds colliding 
Michael Lu: Is LASA famous? 
Shreya Gupta: it's a magnet school but I feel like it's not as big as bronx sci or something 
Michael Lu: In Texas tho Is it famous 
Shreya Gupta: I think bc the austin area public school system is p good so it's not as high of a concentration of smart boyes oh yeah I'd say so our comp teams are all p good 
Michael Lu: Yeah ur scioly team is pretty boff from what Iâve heard 
Shreya Gupta: yeah sarah cheing was a cap and two of the other caps are at harvard 
Michael Lu: Yes Danika 
Shreya Gupta: yeah danika lol and jenny if you know her and if you know shubhanga (who's a sophomore here) he was a cap too 
Michael Lu: Iâve heard of the shubhanga 
Shreya Gupta: yuh I went to middle school with him lol and then high school and now college it's strange 
Michael Lu: Lol Both big brain path 
Shreya Gupta: dude our middle school doesn't usually feed into the magnet school and literally the first day he looked at me and went "what are YOU doing here?!?" and now. I have somehow managed to end up at the same college 
Michael Lu: ð¤·ââï¸ð¤·ââï¸ð¤·ââï¸ What a coinci dinci 
Shreya Gupta: indeeeed wait how do you know danika tho 
Michael Lu: Hahahaha Went to Harvard one time And she was Interacting with Allen Huang Quite 
Shreya Gupta: h u h no offense to allen but allen is not her type I guess he's tall and asian huh 
Michael Lu: Alcohol solves everything 
Shreya Gupta: yes it does dude my best friend calls drunk danika daniqua bc she really do be wildin 
Michael Lu: She seems quite Wild 
Shreya Gupta: yeah we celebrated new years together and I bump into her a lot at parties shes having a good time in college lol 
Michael Lu: I heard there was ð¥© between her and Sarah 
Shreya Gupta: maybe? idk there's always been some drama in that friend group but it's never anything too bad? like they've stayed friends for 4+ years idk I don't care to get involved 
Michael Lu: Oh Oke Interesting Harvard was quite interesting tho 
Shreya Gupta: haha I'm sure it was dude I need to go over to harvard more often 
Michael Lu: Lolll 
Shreya Gupta: it always just seems like too much of a treck 
Michael Lu: Uberrrr with friends 
Shreya Gupta: but none of my friends know my harvard friendsss except for sarah and cam 
Michael Lu: At least u have Harvard friends 
Shreya Gupta: I mean, we just went to HS together one of my harvard friends thought dhaman was me 
Michael Lu: FFF 
Shreya Gupta: I mean have you ever seen us in the same room at the same time? maybe we're just the same person 
Michael Lu: Lol very different Ppl 
Shreya Gupta: _the same_ honestly tho, we have the same physical descriptors adfjaslk Laura once also thought I was rikita and yelled at me 
Michael Lu: Oh interesting 
Shreya Gupta: I am three people stacked one on top of another 
Michael Lu: Wait who ritika 
Shreya Gupta: bomber tall, indian...

Conversation:
Shreya Gupta: I can't figure out 1 on 042 can you assist? bruh have you checked question 2? I can look @ it tomorrow if you want 
Michael Lu: Have not checked q2 Would be very down to check 6.042 and 18.03 tmrw 
Shreya Gupta: Oh fuck I still have to do 18.03 ahhhhHHHH 
Michael Lu: aaahhhhhhh 
Shreya Gupta: Screams on Killian but make it virtual 
Michael Lu: CPW zoom Ã©vent 
Shreya Gupta: zÃ¶Ã¶m Ã©vÃ¨Ã±t 
Michael Lu: Å¸Ã¨Å 
Shreya Gupta: mÃ¡'Ã m sÄ«r 
Michael Lu: Ye 
Shreya Gupta: I want to go back To MIT My productivity is 0 
Michael Lu: F But same And I have a monitor So I can be doubly unproductive 
Shreya Gupta: :o I should get one of those pro gamer setups With the 3 monitors Yuh 
Michael Lu: ^e.g. e.g. v 
Shreya Gupta: M o r e Bruh that video froze my messenger app 
Michael Lu: Messenger saw the vid and decided to be unproductive F 
Shreya Gupta: I realize that I want a physics glass board thing They seem so cool 
Michael Lu: What that woah isn't that guy writing backwards or they just flip the video idk lmao 
Shreya Gupta: They flip the video lol 
Michael Lu: F would be cooler if he wrote backwards also is that guy even from MIT 
Shreya Gupta: Yuh 
Michael Lu: ai ai in 18.06 the professor just posts youtube videos 3Blue1Brown and shit and old lectures from many years ago 
Shreya Gupta: Hahaha Yeah no this is physics faculty Honestly better than most of the teachers ð This 18.03 pset looks low key hard When it's not just row reduction ð 
Michael Lu: yeah it's interesting ... ð¥º
ðð 
Shreya Gupta: :'( Bruh wtf is this Why is recursion on my pset 
Michael Lu: Idk seymon wanted to be tuff :/ 
Shreya Gupta: He wanted to wrinkle our brains 
Michael Lu: put wrinkles in smooth brain Also would like to cyech 042 later 
Shreya Gupta: Yeos We can chyek them both at the same time? Dude this SDS thing is taking so long 
Michael Lu: F Yeah the hw was very long 
Shreya Gupta: How tf do you do 1c? Wait I may know this Apologies for bothering you 
Michael Lu: F 
Shreya Gupta: I am getting strange numbers Did you get (1-i)^n * i/2? 
Michael Lu: for eigen values? 
Shreya Gupta: No for the formula for a_n I haven't put it in the sin/cos form yet 
Michael Lu: wait what r ur eigen values 
Shreya Gupta: 1+-i 
Michael Lu: ye I can't read my own work tho i wrote down (1 + i)^n for some reason 
Shreya Gupta: Uhm we might have put them in a different order So then your top right term would be different I pity your grader sir 
Michael Lu: Yeeeee Our SDS is different S and S^-1 are diff Lo Lol 
Shreya Gupta: Yeah bc we picked different vectors Sad 
Michael Lu: Ohhh Oh well 
Shreya Gupta: Bro what 
Michael Lu: Yeah idk why thatâs there I think it was like converting the expression to rulers formula thing 
Shreya Gupta: I got what you got But the theta's are negative And a 1/2 term 
Michael Lu: Ok 1/2 term where Kewl 
Shreya Gupta: Can you explain 4b ð 
Michael Lu: Honestly irk 6.042 is due in 2 hrs F 
Shreya Gupta: Yeah I'm about to chjeck rn 
Michael Lu: Did u get 4 
Shreya Gupta: On? 
Michael Lu: I feel like there was a typo 18.03 
Shreya Gupta: No I was eating dinner So I haven't gotten far 
Michael Lu: Itâs due tmrw 
Shreya Gupta: Far on 4 I'm on 4b lol 
Michael Lu: I can check 042 in the meantime 
Shreya Gupta: Yeah sure Lemme send you a PDF ? 
Michael Lu: I will tell Lol itâs false 
Shreya Gupta: Oh wait bc it has to be distinct eigenVECTORS Gr Why is semyon making my life hard this week 
Michael Lu: Can u explain #2 e, i, k 
Shreya Gupta: the way I understood it is basically the problem looks like this: 8:59 - 9:00: _ _ _ _ _ _ 9:00 - 9:01: _ _ _ _ _ _ 
Michael Lu: O ur prob right for e 
Shreya Gupta: and you care both about which category and the order it's in 
Michael Lu: Iâm dum What abt I and I K 
Shreya Gupta: i) 6 choices of species, 15 remaining trees to burn (since you've taken out 3 with your first choice) 
Michael Lu: Why u multiply by 6 
Shreya Gupta: 6 choice of species so you could not burn oak and then it's 15 choose 6 
Michael Lu: Yes 
Shreya Gupta: or you could not burn fir and it's another 15 choose 6 
Michael Lu: O 
Shreya Gupta: so you're doing the 15 choose 6 for every type of tree species and there's 6 species 
Michael Lu: Oke What abt k 
Shreya Gupta: ooh wait my k might be wrong bc I might be doublecounting so my logic was you have the choice of small, medium, large twice and then you have 16 trees left but I think I'm double counting somewhere bc choosing large fir and then burning medium fir too is the same as choosing medium fir and burning large fir too 
Michael Lu: Fusiofugiuctydu idk 
Shreya Gupta: wait I shall check with cameron and then get back to you on that 
Michael Lu: Also for #4d I think u added I stead of subtracted 
Shreya Gupta: ooh yes you right thanks for catching that 2e is 7*6! bc you can arrange the trees in 6! ways and the time split is a stars and bars type problem so you can put the bar in 7 different places but stars and bars with order 
Michael Lu: So then is 2f Also different 
Shreya Gupta: I'll let you know 2f. 2^6 - 2 
Michael Lu: Okeeeee what abt i j k 
Shreya Gupta: we're thinkinag about k 
Michael Lu: Oke 
Shreya Gupta: wait what did you put for k? 
Michael Lu: 6 * 16 choose 4 
Shreya Gupta: and j bc j will also have doublecounting fuck 
Michael Lu: 3 * 17 choose 5 Are we also double counting on I i Lol 
Shreya Gupta: no I don't think so since it's an entire species that gets yeeted 
Michael Lu: ^ F brilliant way of putting that 
Shreya Gupta: thank k is 18 choose 6 - 15 choose 6 nvm that's j sorry j. 18 choose 6 - 15 choose 6 k. (18,6) - (12,6) 
Michael Lu: O quite interesting 
Shreya Gupta: yee 
Michael Lu: Yeeeee Thkye 
Shreya Gupta: I'mma turn it in

Michael Lu: O lmao Idk But somebody posted on piazza âI donât understand why the answer is Câ And I was like ok lmao thx 
Shreya Gupta: lmaooo also this pset looks hard and I don't want to do it like not brain hard but comp hard 
Michael Lu: Yes Was 
Shreya Gupta: :((((((( chyek? dude 18.03 is so ong *long 
Michael Lu: F I can chec 6.042 in the mean time 
Shreya Gupta: yeah sure thank

Michael Lu: E Ya 
Shreya Gupta: Bro 
Michael Lu: Bree Which q 
Shreya Gupta: 4 and 5 ð How solid is your explanation for 4a Bc I feel like it's just a bit hand wavey 
Michael Lu: Very Would recommend asking bigger brain 5 I checked with Cameron and the code he wrote and I think he got the same answers 
Shreya Gupta: You have a v big brain! Mmm. I shall give it another go 
Michael Lu: What did u get for 5 
Shreya Gupta: I got literally nowhere I just gave up and decided to do physics and come back to it And now I'm done physics 
Michael Lu: Ye ye 
Shreya Gupta: So I have no choice but to do 042 ð Last pset tho 
Michael Lu: ð ye Have u done 18.03 
Shreya Gupta: Who do you think I am Ma'am I'mma do it this weekend 
Michael Lu: Is not due tmrw?

Sophia Chan: hiiii do u know how to do 3g for 036 homework? im just kinda confused by the code part haha 
Michael Lu: Hiiuiiiiiuiii! Do u still need Do some weird WX+B magic Get probabilities Then take the index of the highest probability per datapoint and that should correspond to a class U should get 
Sophia Chan: i got it thanks so so so much!!!! how have u been???? how's home? 
Michael Lu: Lonly 
Sophia Chan: awwww at least u've still got an app to stalk ur fronds :00 
Michael Lu: ð¥ºð¥ºð¥º Hahaha perhaps How is ur home I forgot whether thatâs Arizona Hong Kong or someplace else 
Sophia Chan: hahaha im actually not home rn :) ): my parents r in hk so they thought it'd be too much stress to go back there and stuff so im staying w a friend in mass rn! is ny crazy rn?? 
Michael Lu: Eh lowkey :D Itâs gettin better

Sophia Chan: hi hi! have u done 036 this week? im stuck on 1A lmao 
Michael Lu: Udiajjsjsjajaj 1A was harddddd Lemme pull it up 
Sophia Chan: ughhhh this is hour 4 of me doing this lmao sorry im dum 
Michael Lu: No maâam 036 is just cancer deer Cancer* 
Sophia Chan: LMAO i was no where close 
Michael Lu: F ð® 
Sophia Chan: how did u figure out the indices for Xt and Yt also thank u ur too kind (': 
Michael Lu: So if X is a matrix Each column is one data point, and each data point has letâs say F number of features, and F = number of rows in X So when we select with weird [:, j] it means we want to get the entire j-th column ":" indicates selecting all the data along the axis = 0 (vertical axis) ^ you can see some examples like that and j just means we select the j-th column in X, like column 1, 2, 3, ... all the way up to N/K-th column in the for loop is that what u were asking abt? :o 
Sophia Chan: YES that is perfect thank you!!! im drawing everything u said out to think about it more rn haha 
Michael Lu: yeyee 
Sophia Chan: <3 
Michael Lu: after problem 1 pset is not as cancer but lmk if uneed anything 
Sophia Chan: too kind sir ur the best seriously 
Michael Lu: yee np :)

Michael Lu: 1 down 
Victor Polizu: Yayay 
Michael Lu: and it would be mes, btw 
Victor Polizu: Yes sir 
Michael Lu: but that's not correct, use les bc reflexive verb is used speaking of which fix 
Victor Polizu: Is brosser incorrect? Should it be peigner 
Michael Lu: verb choice is not the mistake this is a conceptual error 
Victor Polizu: What is conceptual 
Michael Lu: is grammar concept related 
Victor Polizu: Is it like the rendu part? Je me suis rendu Ã  l'Ã©cole Fuck 
Michael Lu: nope Hier, j'ai utilisÃ© un peigne pour me brossÃ© mon cheveux chÃ¢tain that is what you typed mistake is in there besides mon 
Victor Polizu: Wait JE M'AI BROSSÃ Wait

Victor Polizu: Pour Je me suis brossÃ© 
Michael Lu: nope there is no subject which means - 
Victor Polizu: Do I add Je 
Michael Lu: no if there's no subject, then what doesn't happen to the verb? 
Victor Polizu: No agreement? 
Michael Lu: exactly 
Victor Polizu: Pour me brosse 
Michael Lu: no conjugation, etc. warm 
Victor Polizu: What the fuck 
Michael Lu: almost there 
Victor Polizu: Michael 
Michael Lu: wat 
Victor Polizu: Pour me brosse Les cheveux chÃ¢tain 
Michael Lu: if there is no subject, there is no conjugation 
Victor Polizu: So brosser is infinitive? 
Michael Lu: yessssssssssssss 
Victor Polizu: I had that 
Michael Lu: no brosse is not infinitive 
Victor Polizu: Pour me brosser 
Michael Lu: yes that's correct 
Victor Polizu: Another question

Michael Lu: if it was a typo nvm try the classzone thing tho 
Victor Polizu: Isn't there an object ahead of it or is that only rule for reflexive past? 
Michael Lu: that is only for reflexive past, as they use etre NO AGREEMENT WITH AVOIR as of now AGREEMENT WITH REFLEXIVE ETRE EXCEPT WHEN DIRECT OBJECT das da rules 
Victor Polizu: So j'ai utilisÃ© Le rouge, Je me suis maquiller la figure 
Michael Lu: no agreement is not the same as conjugation 
Victor Polizu: Je me suis maquillÃ© 
Michael Lu: yep 
Victor Polizu: La figure 
Michael Lu: don't use la figure 
Victor Polizu: Wait 
Michael Lu: se maquiller probably won't take an object and le rouge wadafuq 
Victor Polizu: Elle se maquille la figure, Elle s'est maquillÃ©e, Elle s'est maquillÃ© la figure

Victor Polizu: 19 and 20 
Michael Lu: 1 mole = 6.02 * 10^23 of anything 1 mole could be 6.02 * 10^23 molecules of a substance 
Victor Polizu: So what would u do for these questions 
Michael Lu: that was for 19 
Victor Polizu: Why would I multiply it by though We barely learned this 
Michael Lu: you multiply because for every mole of a substance, there are 6.02 * 10^23 particles of that substance per mole 
Victor Polizu: What would I multiply by is what I meant 
Michael Lu: 1 mole of CH4 = 6.02 * 10^23 particles of CH4 6.02 * 10^23 2 mole of CH4 = 2 moles * 6.02 * 10^23 particles per mole 
Victor Polizu: Multiply 6.02 * 10^23 by 2 is answer to 19? 
Michael Lu: no multiply it by 1 because they are asking for 1 mole Number of particles = 6.02 * 10^23 times number of moles 
Victor Polizu: Ok what about for 20 
Michael Lu: Total grams = number of moles * molar mass of substance

Michael Lu: did u pass the variable in as a parameter? 
Victor Polizu: Yes 
Michael Lu: do you print the method result or the variable? 
Victor Polizu: Yes the method works perfectly and gives the right answer however the variable isn't sent to the driver class The driver class reads true while it's false (it says true cuz I initialize it at true but it should go through method) 
Michael Lu: what does your method do? 
Victor Polizu: I'll explain tmrw in library Can you come tmrw at library?

Conversation:
Victor Polizu: Michael 
Michael Lu: What 
Victor Polizu: Can I ask you French question? 
Michael Lu: Yea 
Victor Polizu: So When you use adjectives as nouns (Je ressens l'affection) can you also say "Je ressens de l'affection"? 
Michael Lu: You have to use de 
Victor Polizu: So the parentheses is wrong 
Michael Lu: Yes 
Victor Polizu: In class she gave us a shit ton of examples that only had "Elle ressent l'amitiÃ©" 
Michael Lu: L'amitiÃ© means friendship 
Victor Polizu: Oh so for like affection and admiration, you use de la 
Michael Lu: Using l'amitiÃ© doesn't make sense 
Victor Polizu: Oh wait Elle ressent la satisfaction ^Thats wrong? 
Michael Lu: Yes 
Victor Polizu: But she gave it to us in class 
Michael Lu: She did? 
Victor Polizu: If you look in the notes, there was a question that said "Quel vocabulaire pouvons-nous en sortir?" She made us write a lot of sentences down Ones with adjectives and ones with adjective nouns 
Michael Lu: I don't have this. 
Victor Polizu: Elle est optimiste. Elle ressent l'optimisme That was one of the sentences Elle est affectueuse. Elle ressent de l'affection. Why for some there is de and for some there isn't? 
Michael Lu: Idk pretty sure you have to use de Ask her tmrw 
Victor Polizu: Wait What about using se sentir 
Michael Lu: You use an adverb 
Victor Polizu: Je me sens de l'affection doesn't sound right But is it? 
Michael Lu: It's not 
Victor Polizu: Yay So give example 
Michael Lu: Je me sens bien 
Victor Polizu: Lol I know that one but like Any emotions from this chapter? Je me sens mauvais Je me sens GAY 
Michael Lu: What. 
Victor Polizu: Je me sens mal 
Michael Lu: Yes You got it 
Victor Polizu: Yes 
Michael Lu: Good 
Victor Polizu: So you use adjective nouns with ressentir, adverbs with se sentir and adjective with Ãªtre? 
Michael Lu: Yeah Generally 
Victor Polizu: But this de thing is weird cuz I see "on Ã©prouve de l'amitiÃ©, de l'affection, du respect" but also "Elle ressent la satisfaction" maybe for some specific adjective nouns you use "de" 
Michael Lu: Look it up Or ask her tmrw 
Victor Polizu: Ok, also I want to apologize for the Jag I was last year, I was like "Stop showing off your intelligence on Facebook" I wanna punch that Victor in the face. I was really insecure and what not. I guess I took it out on you. I'm sorry

Conversation:
Victor Polizu: L'environnement est trÃ¨s important. Ainsi, on peut donner une seconde vie Ã  un objet. Câest le rÃ©emploi. Beaucoup des gens pensent que seuls les pauvres rÃ©utilisent les objets. Mais cette dÃ©claration est incorrecte. Beaucoup des gens Ã  se tourner vers dâautres circuits parce que il y a d'inflation. En France, il y a de 5000 structures de rÃ©emploi. Par exemple, il y a des sites de vente aux enchÃ¨res. Il y a des vides-grenier aussi qui sont des ventes des objets dâune maison. Il y a des dÃ©pots-ventes, les revendeurs et les entreprises de rÃ©insertion. Mais il ya des problÃ¨mes avec le rÃ©emploi aussi. Par exemple, quand un homme achÃ¨te par internet ou en vide-grenier, l'objet quâil a achetÃ© peut Ãªtre cassÃ©. Ce nâest pas juste. Lâhomme a payÃ© beaucoup dâargent pour une frigo ou une micro-onde et quand il arrive chez lui, il trouve que cette objet ne marche pas. Une autre problÃ¨me est que les appareils Ã©lectromÃ©nagers et le matÃ©riel informatique peinent Ã  trouver une seconde vie. Il y a beaucoup des appareils Ã©lectromÃ©nagers mais il nây a pas beaucoup des gens qui peut les utiliser encore un fois. Mais les livres, les CDs, les DVDs, les jeux et les articles de dÃ©coration peuvent la trouver. Il y a des avantages et des dÃ©savantages avec le rÃ©emploi. If you want, can you tell me how this is?

Michael Lu: Does she care? 
Weiting Hong: never tried to not do them are you doing that alien & sedition DBQ right now you shouldn't worry too much 
Michael Lu: Nah French and Indian war or articles of confederation 
Weiting Hong: oh ok 
Michael Lu: So does she use the AP rubric to grade, and how many points is the essay 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Is it even possible to study for a DBQ? Lol just make sure I am not a dumbass I guess XD 
Weiting Hong: Know the big idea and the events So you can use outside examples in your bodies Tria and AP likes outside information What's the DBQ on again Articles of confederation? Maybe know the federalist and the anti federalist and their viewpoints might be helpful Like Hamilton wants a national bank and stuff

Michael Lu: ??? Last year Wellâs test å¸å¥??? 
Weiting Hong: o h i was annoying him with air resistance answering everything with air resistance 
Michael Lu: Lmao How u do it 
Weiting Hong: the question? dont remember my fren 
Michael Lu: Air resistance 
Weiting Hong: o calculus fbd 
Michael Lu: Dayum Did u ever get it wrong with air resistance 
Weiting Hong: lmao i never actually put air resistance 
Michael Lu: O 
Weiting Hong: i didn't know how to do it last year it was just a meme 
Michael Lu: Oke did u actually calculate air resistance last year 
Weiting Hong: no 
Michael Lu: Oh lol gud meme 
Weiting Hong: (y)

Weiting Hong: will send you a copy later when is it due 
Michael Lu: Nah I just need tips 
Weiting Hong: eric kinda used learning i kinda hard-coded common strategies people won't think too hard so if you can predict strategies you wreck them 
Michael Lu: Lol noice

Weiting Hong: so i am not the best person to give advices 
Michael Lu: Was your project good? 
Weiting Hong: and we did performance imo it was trollz

Weiting Hong: w8 sorry some other kids asked me for it too and i couldn't find it and sure, what about the research paper? i feel i wouldn't be able to help you much cuz all my papers are bullshit 
Michael Lu: Does Graham care if u cite a src once 
Weiting Hong: Wdym? Like you have a source and you used it only once? That should be fine I think??

Weiting Hong: boi sup 
Michael Lu: Water those 
Weiting Hong: oi nice integration over an area/volume its just a fancy sign denoting that you want to integrate over the area/volume of interest same thing, over the length (at least thats what i think they are) 
Michael Lu: Are they different than the regular integration boi In terms of actual function/procedure 
Weiting Hong: they are the same, but when you are setting up limits of integration or interpreting formulas, these provide more information about what you want to do procedure is the smae usually those circles are about an enclosed region or volume as in Gauss's law maybe read that, that can help 
Michael Lu: Is this a physics thing Or is it used in abstract math? 
Weiting Hong: whats abstract math? haven't learned so far only place i have seen these in is Physics C 
Michael Lu: Like is this used in math Ever 
Weiting Hong: idk fren 
Michael Lu: Without physics Oke 
Weiting Hong: why is everyone asking me this rn is this a dickson thing 
Michael Lu: Who is everyone 
Weiting Hong: oh nvm 
Michael Lu: lol K

Michael Lu: Yo Who is more worth having Yi for Econ If graham for English 


Conversation:
Weiting Hong: Graham for English gives workload Yi is fine 
Michael Lu: Who give more work Yo or mooney 
Weiting Hong: Why are you comparing them :0 don't you need both Econ and eng? Oh nvm I felt Yi kids had a easier time None of them give a lot of work I feel? But mooney kids seem to struggle with tests

Weiting Hong: Yea 
Michael Lu: How many per quarter? Any tests? 
Weiting Hong: No idea You shouldnât worry for sure Iâm not even good at English Survived with shit writing anyway So You have nothing to worry Not just making you feel good here itâs the truth

Conversation:
Michael Lu: Shuai Ge Just wonderin Whatâs ur candid take on the college political game Like affirmative action, gender balance in STEM, major quotas, geographical represent, etc. And tips on dealing with it? 
Weiting Hong: Oh Iâm just salty all the time I feel you canât really control any factor aside from major quotas Apparently all three Stanfords in my year applied for earth science / planet system or something along those line But none actually pursuing?? 
Michael Lu: Yeah I heard 
Weiting Hong: So that provides some possibilities 
Michael Lu: And they all went to camp for IESO 
Weiting Hong: Ah ok When I was applying I just didnât do anything regarding those factors Maybe that was a mistake 
Michael Lu: At least u were honest man Props to u 
Weiting Hong: Lmao ty bro But colleges donât care tho So if you have an edge somewhere Use it I would say 
Michael Lu: Lol Asian stem boi Canât XD 
Weiting Hong: Allow me to give you sad reacc 
Michael Lu: Any majors for my demographic that are suicidal? 
Weiting Hong: At least you are not on visa my bro Um I am not sure about that I mean like you see lots of Asian boys in MIT anyway But they are god-tier So ð¤·ââï¸ 
Michael Lu: Dam do all Asian boi have to be super decorated Seems rlly unfair 
Weiting Hong: Seemed to me too Oh well Best of luck man 
Michael Lu: Gah college bullshit hurts every time 
Weiting Hong: But I feel you will do really fine 
Michael Lu: DOJ pls sodemize harvard harder 
Weiting Hong: Just go with your gut feelings I guess 
Michael Lu: What abt Lynne and Harvard How do 
Weiting Hong: Lol Idk man Heard from someone else that only Harvard accepted her Not other ivies 
Michael Lu: S H A D E 
Weiting Hong: Sad reacc only 
Michael Lu: Agree 
Weiting Hong: Also she is going for psychology Never saw that in her but maybe thatâs where her interest is 
Michael Lu: Shouldnât ur major reflect extracurriculars? 
Weiting Hong: It most definitely should I think But I donât know her enough ð¤·ââï¸ So you see This entire process Is very annoying Mostly because you perceive unfairness but you canât really do things about it 
Michael Lu: Agree 
Weiting Hong: Like my mother doesnât have a doctor degree and didnât donate a library So I guess just go ahead. It annoys you more the more you think about it Plus I think even with these stuff you will do fine anyway 
Michael Lu: Shibe ;( Kk apprec8 wisdom èå¸ Hong 
Weiting Hong: Lmao sorry I didnât help a lot Good luck tho Maybe I will see you in school during thanksgiving bro

Michael Lu: Writing I got a q When colleges check senior grades RD Is it by quarter or semester Aka check two quarters Or just first semester 
Weiting Hong: I think when our school send mid term report Itâs a combined grade right 
Michael Lu: Lol idk ð 
Weiting Hong: Wait no I have a feeling itâs by quarter Cuz when you receive 2,3,4 quarter reports You see everything 
Michael Lu: Is it just letter? 
Weiting Hong: That yes How did earlies go for everyone 
Michael Lu: Shit ton of Cornellâs so far Thatâs it 
Weiting Hong: Yeaaa saw those Did anyone else get sTanFord or larger ivies 
Michael Lu: Just ethan

Conversation:
William Cai: hi Litty just curious....... does Graham have Google classroom? 
Michael Lu: soon 


Conversation:
William Cai: Hi Litty is all the literature terms due on Monday ? 
Michael Lu: No 
William Cai: are * 
Michael Lu: The first page 
William Cai: rip. sorry ok definition only? or every term needs an example from black boy ? 
Michael Lu: Idk 
William Cai: eh..... I vaguely remember that he said we need to write definition + example from black boy.....? or I might be wrong 
Michael Lu: Yes he did. I guess you could do it 
William Cai: ok....... wait. do we need to print out? or turn it in through Google classroom? 
Michael Lu: Either 
William Cai: Ok. thank you Litty ! lol. gonna sleep rn. so tired. studied for the quiz until 3 yesterday. good night Litty! 
Michael Lu: Gnight 


Conversation:
William Cai: Hi Litty just wondering. if this is the right format...... so I don't need to put anything in the provision column. and British action is just what the acts are about . right ? 
Michael Lu: U r good 
William Cai: thanks Litty 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Hello, what did you do in English 
William Cai: oh hi. you feel better now? 
Michael Lu: Yes what did you learn in English 
William Cai: oh well. Graham just continued the literm and associated with Black Boy I can send the note to you if you want 
Michael Lu: Ya pls 
William Cai: May I have your email? 
Michael Lu: Can I send a pic here 
William Cai: sure 
Michael Lu: You* Thx 
William Cai: oh. ok and also he mentioned about studying the vocab in class

Conversation:
Michael Lu: will can u help me out did you do your APUSH Ratification debate paper? 
William Cai: I just started it ðð anything I can help ? 
Michael Lu: lol if so the nope XD but it's about how tf do should i use the anti-federalist papers in my research if im a federalist 
William Cai: eh...... you can't point out the places that are not making sense in the anti fed. paper 
Michael Lu: okay. i guess so thx :) 
William Cai: coz if you do so it will make your position stronger from the point of view the person that we have?.... 
Michael Lu: yes 
William Cai: how about answering the question ? 
Michael Lu: everything is from the POV of ur person 
William Cai: so I should say James Madison support the........... or I should write I support....... 
Michael Lu: don't use either 
William Cai: so it's like a persuasive essay but from your assigned persons perspective 
Michael Lu: Yes But its less persuasion More of answer the questions 
William Cai: thanks a lot ð 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Wait do you legit sit in on Physics C classes? Is Sckalor okay with it? XD 
William Cai: yeah....lol I'm in his physics 1 class and I know him well. ððð he's pretty chill with that 
Michael Lu: Lol What stuff do you learn? 
William Cai: basically all the stuff in physics C..... lol eh... applying calculus in physics questions and deriving formula pretty chill class 
Michael Lu: Yah what topics 
William Cai: topics in physcis 1 and 2 + electric flux and more electric magnetism wait but not including Morden physics aka. fake physics.  lmao ðð

Conversation:
William Cai: Hi Litty.  sorry . May I know what should be included in the List of indictments ? 
Michael Lu: Charges against the man What you would sue him in court for 
William Cai: so basically is a T chart included both of them wait.. but what perspective should it be like from which group's  point of view should I write 
Michael Lu: Write why you would charge the man from an accusation POV Then write why you would defend him from defender POV 
William Cai: oh. I see. ð® got it. thanks a lot dude. ðð good night Litty! 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Hi fren can you help with basic electronics probkem 
William Cai: yep. if it's not really deep physics C question .  I think I can handle it. lolð 
Michael Lu: No this is simple confirmation stuff 
William Cai: ok 
Michael Lu: 12 LEDs 
William Cai: ok 
Michael Lu: About 2V voltage and 0.20 mA current draw For a full series circuit 
William Cai: ok 
Michael Lu: Would I need 24 V battery? 
William Cai: wait. you mean for one led. each one require 2 V and 0.2 mA right ?. just make sure I get the gist correct ... 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
William Cai: yep it's right 
Michael Lu: What if I have an 18 V battery Would I need parallel? Two parallel lines 6 LED eah Each* 
William Cai: ehm. ok. so two parallel lines 6 LED for each. then the current for each LED will be 0.0006 amp.... that will probably blow up the LED. unfortunately ð 
Michael Lu: How did you find that current? 
William Cai: oh wait. it should be 0.0003 amp my bad 
Michael Lu: How did you get that? 
William Cai: wait a sec. let me write it down 
Michael Lu: Okay, Iâm trusting you So what resistor would do the job on each line? 330 ohm? 
William Cai: base on the data you send me. 2V and 0.2 mA for LED. I can calculate that the resistance should be pretty big. which is 10000 ohm. which is pretty big coz they should be lower 
Michael Lu: Yeah I see where that came from 
William Cai: coz usually they should be around 10 ohm. I guess ? 
Michael Lu: Wait does LED resistance actually matter? 
William Cai: in order to make the LED shine like a diamond ~~ yeah.. because this relates to how much current you can have for each LED. not sure for 18V though.  you can probably try other parallel situations or use combination I think ? 
Michael Lu: Online videos donât really mention it 
William Cai: you mean the resistance ? 
Michael Lu: They just subtract LED voltage and power supply votafe And divide that by current to get resistance 
William Cai: wait. you consider there's internal resistance in battery ...? 
Michael Lu: Nobody considered any internal resistance 
William Cai: wait. but why they subtract the LED voltage and power supply in order to get the resistance of the LED though 
Michael Lu: Voltage distribution to components? 
William Cai: in which kind of circuit ? 
Michael Lu: Simple series? 
William Cai: yes. it's proportion to resistance of the component let me try it. ð oh I see why they also have resistors in the circuit.  that's why 
Michael Lu: Yeah I was gonna get to that Lol now what ð 
William Cai: ððhold on. let me calculate it real quick it's workable just approximate it to 0.2 mA.  ð the LED might be the same brightness 
Michael Lu: So yes? They work? The 330 ohm resistors? 
William Cai: you mean the 33000 ohm ? 
Michael Lu: Dafuq 
William Cai: ......wait. I think i generate the different one ð± 2 V and 0.2mA 
Michael Lu: Lemme see ur input Diode current is already in mA You put in 0.2 mA I put in 20 mA 
William Cai: oh. ok. coz the in the beginning we used 0.2 mA..... 
Michael Lu: Oh shit My bad Lol ð 
William Cai: ðð it's fine 
Michael Lu: I meant 20 mA 
William Cai: that's why I'm so consumed with the resistance 
Michael Lu: Lol my bad 
William Cai: np ðð let me just do another quick math to make sure. sorry . yes it's workable 465 ohm and the total resistance the result is current for each line it's pretty close result. so yeah. it will work ð 
Michael Lu: Okay cool Finally, will each LED in the line be the same brightness? 
William Cai: yes. coz same current for all of them 
Michael Lu: Cool Alright thx man, sry for the confusion With the current 
William Cai: np. at all 
Michael Lu: Lol u were a great help tho thx :) 
William Cai: a pleasure to solve the circuit question with you ! ð good luck with your new project.  lol the LED railgun ð 
Michael Lu: Xd 
William Cai: alright man. gonna sleep. have a good night Litty! 
Michael Lu: GN u too 


Conversation:
William Cai: sorry Litty .  but for this question .... does he mean before the departure or after the departure ? 
Michael Lu: Umm I think he refers to the second departure He asks for the cause of Douglas leaving Baltimore 
William Cai: is it due to the property distribution after somebody died? and his grandma got kick out something like that? 
Michael Lu: I think the later one Near the end of the chapter 
William Cai: alirhgt, got it. thanks a lot litty !! ð

Conversation:
William Cai: Hello sir, lol. sorry may I ask you a quick question about the dbq ? 
Michael Lu: Lol whatâs u Up 
William Cai: oh yeah, it says " Roosevelt is commonly thought of as a liberal and Hoover as a conservative. To what extent are these characterizations valid? " does it mean how their ways to approach the administration demonstrate whether they are liberal or conservative right ? 
Michael Lu: Yeah If u look at the documents Itâs retarded because they scream that Hoover was a conservative and Roosevelt was liberal But not really They want you to prove how both are one way Then disprove it in a confession Concession* 
William Cai: I just started to look at it . lol 
Michael Lu: Saem 
William Cai: I was thinking about to approach this stuff through talking about their takes on social reform, economy, and politics (but at first I wan't really sure about the question the dbq is asking. lol .... can't English...rip) but anyway, thx a lot Litty ! 
Michael Lu: Np

Michael Lu: Sure 
William Cai: does split infinitive consider as a type of modifier error? ... it's on one website that graham posted... 
Michael Lu: Which one 
William Cai: http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/quizzes/niu/niu9.htm is it going to be one the test tmr? he never mentions it in class.... 
Michael Lu: Split? 
William Cai: yeah 
Michael Lu: Yes It is I think Where is the sentence U were referring to 
William Cai: "John wants to really do well on this exam" 
Michael Lu: Really is misplaced I believe It isnât modifying do It modifies well I think 
William Cai: it should be "do really well" .... oh ok. ic 
Michael Lu: Yah

Michael Lu: If ~3000 V passÃ© thru there (Circles are paper clips) Does that hurt you ^ Or does that hurt 
William Cai: ........ ? 
Michael Lu: What 
William Cai: sorry... I didn't quite get what you just sent me.. 
Michael Lu: Letâs say thereâs a circuit With high voltage But not enough current to kill 
William Cai: you didn't send me the photo at all......though ... 
Michael Lu: Oh did it not go they Through 
William Cai: oh lol let me see I don't think it will hurt you the resistance of the paper clip should be pretty low or non since it's a pretty good conductor (I guess) and your body resistance is huge compare to the paper clip 
Michael Lu: Yep now what if you put two fingers in parallel 
William Cai: so the current won't bother to go through you i think 
Michael Lu: Still nothing? Iâm talking like 1000 - 2000 V here bye Btw 
William Cai: like this ? 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
William Cai: I don't think you will get hurt in both case. lol 
Michael Lu: Will try it it Aight

William Cai: yes sir. I will text him the account information message sent. I will take a look at the disk info tonight. god speed for sentence outline Are we meeting after school today, 
Michael Lu: Got sudden robotics shit after school Will find you After 
William Cai: Np Btw. Spinelli is in 214 today so we can meet in that room I got the info of the disk and put in a shared doc 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Sir Lmk what battery and holder you choose Creating 3V prototype Be conscious about dimension constraints for width and height Send me links and order ASAP William One week left 
William Cai: Yes chief. I'm looking at it rn. I will update the doc in 30 min 
Michael Lu: Also Thread Thin thread that does not fray Order that 3V system built very powerful 
William Cai: I will send you the battery and holder info (the info is also in the doc)+ (the battery and holder fit together) i'm looking at the thread now 
Michael Lu: Send vibratory link Battery holder fits battery? 
William Cai: yes 
Michael Lu: Good get thread 
William Cai: CR2032 battery holder fit CR 2032 battery 
Michael Lu: We should meet tmrw 
William Cai: i'm looking for it 
Michael Lu: Oh wait nvm 
William Cai: can we use plastic wire to replace string/thread? 
Michael Lu: Whenever the parts arrive Plastic wire? 
William Cai: the one you guys used for sioly? 
Michael Lu: We did? I feel like this would be too stiff 
William Cai: i'm looking for a one that is thinner 
Michael Lu: Iâm talking about as thin as dental floss 
William Cai: but it won't fray... 
Michael Lu: Nope 
William Cai: ....ok... 
Michael Lu: It has to wrap around switch head And be glued For secure connection Also that shit expensive Twisty wire Just do thread Weâll see if fraying is actually a problem 
William Cai: ok. then I will get dentist floss 
Michael Lu: No floss Floss is more complicated to manufacture prob With the flavors and casing and shit 
William Cai: alright. let me keep looking for another one 
Michael Lu: Get raw thread Idk this shit man^ I want to fabricate shit So order soon So far itâs a solid parts list Thatâs looks better Go ahead with that 
William Cai: ok. just double check with the ordering list: 1. battery (pack of 20) 2. holder (pack of 20) 3. raw thread ok the doctor didn't add the payment yet. I think I will use my card first 
Michael Lu: Is this two day shipping? 
William Cai: the battery and holder are two day shipping 
Michael Lu: Order up chief 
William Cai: ok is two day shipping this one is 2-day

Michael Lu: It will be an honor To work with you on the Dr.âs project 
William Cai: same to me a honor to work with you. dang. you're so good at doing the application stuff like I just can't do it like you do thanks for carrying me so far into this project chief .. 
Michael Lu: Lol ur important too Chief 
William Cai: oh yeah. I schedule the meeting with the dr. probably sunday 6pm. 
Michael Lu: Did u log in any hours 
William Cai: I dind't get to work on it yet I'm expecting to grind 3hours tmr though 
Michael Lu: Log your hours in google docs So I can put them into google sheets 
William Cai: Got it boss. I will start working around 7:00 PM so we will still have two different prototypes to show him? i mean not prototypes with similar design but minor difference in details of the design 
Michael Lu: I created a prototype earlier today If u want to try it yourself go ahead As long as weâre putting more and more hours down so we got more $$$ 
William Cai: shall we meet tmr before meeting the dr.? 
Michael Lu: If u want I guess He probably gonna be late tho 
William Cai: lol. I guess maybe a short meeting will be great! 
Michael Lu: How many hours worked? 
William Cai: 1.5 hour boss 
Michael Lu: What times 
William Cai: From 7:30 to 9:00 Pm 
Michael Lu: Cool 
William Cai: What time shall we meet tmr morning? 
Michael Lu: Iâm not available in morning How long do you need to meet for 
William Cai: 15 min To 20 min ish 
Michael Lu: For what purpose 
William Cai: Idk... actually lol To make a third prototype based on the ones we two have? 
Michael Lu: Whatâs your prototype? Accept 4:30 
William Cai: Got it Fck The doc Is coming at 5:30... 
Michael Lu: He changed? 
William Cai: YeH.... 
Michael Lu: Ok 
William Cai: You know this is Not the first time he did it ... 
Michael Lu: I guess if u want we could still meet earlier At 4:30 
William Cai: Yeah sure lol Btw. 
Michael Lu: What 
William Cai: EW is here... 
Michael Lu: Ok So 
William Cai: Just let you know 
Michael Lu: Lol ok Where r u rn 
William Cai: i know this might be a little bit crazy but since our coopration with the dr. is going really well (I guess he thinks we're doing good job). we might want to consider negotiate with him about the percent of share we might have in this product I think 1.9%-2.5% of stock for each of us? like we decrease our pay to $10-11.5 but we will be able to have a share in the stock 
Michael Lu: Classic Oh about your negotiations 
William Cai: ys chief 
Michael Lu: Donât dock our pay Yet We canât be confident that this will be successful 
William Cai: i know... 
Michael Lu: Weâll discuss our share when the time comes 
William Cai: ok 
Michael Lu: But heâd probably try to hoard the profits himself anyways 
William Cai: but is it better to do it earlier? true fact. xd hold on what if we say we can help him open up the market in China i mean we're both chinese 
Michael Lu: Thatâs a discussion for a later time When the damn thing is manufactured 
William Cai: true... but we could still have a general idea so that we won't let the opportunities slip from our hands. 
Michael Lu: Look Heâs filing the patent So.... Unless my company Gets their foot in the door And contributes Thatâs when shit gets interesting 
William Cai: that's true let's make the plan according to the situation 
Michael Lu: Get doctor Check his email 
William Cai: I'm checking I didn't see anything though 
Michael Lu: Get doctor to check his email 
William Cai: Oh shit sorry my bad. Doing rn It's the email from the company right? 
Michael Lu: Yeah they want to make an appointment with him 


Conversation:

William Cai: I'm coming Are you in the architecture room? 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Do you have the amazon links for disk 
William Cai: the one above is the 30,000 rmp would you like me to place to order or you want to do it? (we can compare these two types of disks) 
Michael Lu: Do w hav these already or no? 
William Cai: I think it's the similar one? but i think it's ok to order... lol 
Michael Lu: I meant get the links for the old one from the doctor We need to make sure Weâre buying something better 
William Cai: the 12,000 rpm is the one that the doctor bought us it's confirmed 
Michael Lu: What abt size Are the ones above bigger? 
William Cai: the 30,000 is 10mm * 2.5 mm whereas the 12,000 is 10mm * 3 mm only minor difference between the size of these disks 
Michael Lu: Same diameter? 
William Cai: yes chief 
Michael Lu: Do you have the links for the old disks 
William Cai: wait. isn't the 12,000 rpm is the link to the old disks? 
Michael Lu: Is it? Are you sure? 
William Cai: that's the one the doc sent in the group chat.. 
Michael Lu: Are they the bigger ones that we have though? He gave us two disks 
William Cai: crap you're right give me 2min imma find the link to the smaller disk 
Michael Lu: No the link to the bigger disk is what matters Is that the one you already sent? 
William Cai: yeah that's the one i have sent the 12,000 rpm one with 10mm * 3mm I guess I will order the 30,000 rpm one to give it a try since the 30,000 one has the same diameter as the 12,000 rpm one 
Michael Lu: Go for it then We should look for one with a. Bigger size as well 
William Cai: crap. there's a major issue the 30,000 rpm disk is imported from China (ship from China). so it's gonna take forever (april 27th) to get here... 


Conversation:
William Cai: Yes chief Sorry for missing the call... 
Michael Lu: Order this one And then I guess look into the Chinese 30000 RPM idk if thatâs legit tho 
William Cai: 15 pieces right ? 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
William Cai: Got it. Ordering rn Apr 16 is the fastest day the stuff will arrive 
Michael Lu: Go ahead 
William Cai: order placed FYI 
Michael Lu: Log in some hours please Text me her Here Since youâve been calling Chinese companies or something 
William Cai: Yes chief. So far is let's say it's 1.5 hours. Each of is get 1.5 hours If he asks then you says you searched up the information for 1.5 hours and I talked to them on phone for 1.5 hours 
Michael Lu: Meaning send me a time slot To add to the sheet bud For what youâve been working 
William Cai: Ay chief. Roger that 
Michael Lu: Send me a time slot, please?

Michael Lu: Yeah before that Iâll find out what time it ends Iâll msg u 
William Cai: Gotcha 
Michael Lu: 25 prospect street Bring an umbrella Stand outside the fire zone Call me when you arrive 
William Cai: got it I'm outside 
Michael Lu: The fire zone Means outside the fucking firehouse Ask about the casing Plastic casing And tell him since it was a while since we met Our payment went up because âmore hoursâ 
William Cai: So instead of $15 per hour. We will increase the wage by a little? How much do you want to increase? Also. I got the payment $240 in total. I will bring it back to school to you tomorrow We also get a new project. I will send the info to you later on. This project is more hyped. Lpl 
Michael Lu: Whatâs our next task for vivrator Vibrating thing What do we have to do now 
William Cai: Not really a vibrator It's the wound dressing 
Michael Lu: Whatâs our next task for the vibratory project What did he tell you to do for next time 
William Cai: He's hyped about the current compact design of the vibratory project he wants us to contact the actual manufacture to see if we can negotiate with them to lower the price of the material 
Michael Lu: What abt the plastic housing 
William Cai: he said that's not that urgent he wants to just put this device in a bandage 
Michael Lu: Ok

Michael Lu: Iâll be there in a few 


Conversation:
William Cai: Salute chief. The batman without mask to secure the community ð 
Michael Lu: I have a physics question 
William Cai: Yes boss. I'm really rusty now. But I will try my best Lol Go ahead 
Michael Lu: Two masses Velocities and angles are given They collide elastically Is it possible to find the resulting velocities and directions of this 2D collision 
William Cai: Let me see You mean like this? 
Michael Lu: Yes 6 given values Two masses, two velocities, two angles 
William Cai: I think so 
Michael Lu: How 
William Cai: You can use this formula to solve for the horizontal and vertical component for each mass 
Michael Lu: But is kinetic energy conserved the same way in each direction? Ur formulas work in 1D Would it work in 2D 
William Cai: When I solve a 2D problem I will break it down into two 1D problems to solve. By intuition I would say the kinetic energy is conserved. But let me try to prove it the total kinetic energy for the system will be conserved. But the kinetic energy in regard of the vertical / horizontal directions will NOT really be the same yeah .... so I can't use that short cut formula ... but you can still use 1. momentum in each direction is concersed 2. total kinetic energy of the system is conserved to solve it 
Michael Lu: Ok thx will! 
William Cai: np. hope this one will be helpful. 


Conversation:
William Cai: chief. when do you want the meeting with the dr. to be?

But (Sadly) he loves Brutus CASSIUS LOVES CAESAR BUT CAESAR LOVES BRUTUS AND NOT HIM DONT YOU SEE THE ENTIRE PLOT AND CONSPIRACY IS REVENGE ON CAESAR FOR NOT LOVING HIM THEN CASSIUS IS GOING TO FRAME BRUTUS TO GET REVENGE ON HIM FOR TAKING THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE ITS SO CLEAR Caesar made Cassius hard, but he knows that Caesar loves Brutus

Michael Lu: you should make budget cuts 
William Yan: one of my paragraphs alone is 1.5 page 
Michael Lu: same 1.3 pg 
William Yan: . 
Michael Lu: 2 of them in fact 
William Yan: I have two .75 pages a 1.5 page and a 1 page idk how I'm over by one page oh wait I know because of the fucking double space and the font change 
Michael Lu: why what font was your outline 
William Yan: it's now 1-1-1.75-1.3 I had arial 11 because it was slightly smaller 
Michael Lu: wow u scrub 
William Yan: I'm just gonna butcher it by taking out some facts but if all else fails I have a backup copy 
Michael Lu: lol wut 
William Yan: original with one paragraph cut out 
Michael Lu: but that exceeds the limi limit* 
William Yan: . no If I cut out one paragraph I'm 1 line before 6 pages 
Michael Lu: the original i mean

Michael Lu: the one with 4 paragraphs that will have 6 pages so you can't use it 
William Yan: The backup copy is a 3 paragraph one the main one

Michael Lu: nice you have the wrong pg number font 
William Yan: oh wow doing that made my essay slightly shorter something was missing 
Michael Lu: okay im done with my paper forever do you think 7% similarity is plagiarism? 
William Yan: . nah 
Michael Lu: k 
William Yan: do you think that if I say that this economist supports free trade and I have him as a citationa uthor that I don't have to cite him 
Michael Lu: economist?? 
William Yan: because he's in the citation ye 
Michael Lu: his name is economist 
William Yan: if he wrote an anti free trade paper and I cited it do I have to cite him wen saying that he is anti-free trade or just put his name in there 
Michael Lu: if you cite him with an "according to" etc then you don't need the parenthicals 
William Yan: . I mean I said that he is anti-free trade and nothing else so do I need to cite him if his name is mentioned no right 
Michael Lu: wtf kinda example is that he is free trade 
William Yan: economists and officials, such as former Labor Secretary Robert Reich (Hindery), and economist Robert E. Scott, Do I need to cite after robert E. Scott or dont I because his name is mentioned 
Michael Lu: what is the fact or the example 
William Yan: there is no fact it's in my intro 
Michael Lu: ohhhh don't cite anything in your intro just because you mention a name doens't mean you need to site it 
William Yan: ok hue Also if I put a comma after U.S. is it U.S., or U.S, 
Michael Lu: US., *U.S., or US, 
William Yan: . k last qusetion if I mention scott's name but I have two sources for him I source it as (*title*) right or (Scott, *title*) 
Michael Lu: idk look it up 
William Yan: . YES I FINISHED ONE MORE LINE TO DELETE 
Michael Lu: lol what did you end up doing 
William Yan: . I didn't delete any of my paragraphs I just used a bunch of condensing techniques and cut out one section of on eparagraph you aim for the lines with a large amount of space in between the words, because it means that it can fit a word in between if a few characters are taken out 
Michael Lu: ??? 
William Yan: asian shortening tricks does the essay require a title I got 7% too 
Michael Lu: essay requires title 
William Yan: ok

Conversation:
William Yan: I finished my poem at least the first half You're sick of feeling numb
You're not the only one
I'll take you by the hand
And I'll show you a world that you can understand
This life is filled with hurt
When happiness doesn't work
Trust me and take my hand definitely not song lyrics that I edited to look like a poem 
Michael Lu: wtf plagiarism and the poem sucks 
William Yan: Well they're song lyrics about love It just sounded remotely like poem topic 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: how's ur poem 
William Yan: Didn't even start it 
Michael Lu: It descended from the heavens
Upon the midnight hour
A great traveller of dimensions
That cast away our glowers

It had a coat of elegance
With fur that shined so bright
A neck of such magnificence
That was so sleek and white

It trod upon the forest floor
With silence and much grace
Scaling the highest of the tors
So easily with haste

It finally approached us all
So we could see its face
A creature standing strong and tall

It was a fluffy llama. lllama 
William Yan: ...

William Yan: But I am A Sunday morning
A peaceful day, like any other
Sitting, working, and reading.
Not knowing what happened to my mother

Suddenly, the peace is shattered
The phone rings on my desk
My father picks it up, why should I?
But how could I prepare for what came next

Downstairs, my father is talking
Saying something about a crash
Curious, I picked up the phone
Then everything changed in a flash

She wasnât coming home tonight
My life would never be the same
What would I do, what could I do?
All that I worked for, gone in a flame

She missed her plane back home
She was supposed to bring me my new phone :/ When is the practice essay due with the poem Modified it to have a better rhyming scheme A Sunday night
A peaceful day, like any other
Working and reading under the light
Not knowing what happened to my mother

Suddenly, the peace is shattered
The phone rings on my desk
My father picks it up, my phone was battered
But how could I prepare for what came next

Downstairs, my father is talking
Saying something about a crash
Curious, I see a different phone and start walking
I turn it on, and everything changed in a flash

She wasnât coming home tonight
My life would never be the same
These next few years I would never be right
All that I worked for, gone in a flame

She missed her plane back home
She was supposed to bring me my new phone :/ 
Michael Lu: lol wuts wrong with you my mum died now i don't get my phone lel u sevege 
William Yan: No the thing is she didn't actually die she just missed her flight home 
Michael Lu: wow lel 
William Yan: Nothing in the poem implies that she died 
Michael Lu: pretty funny 
William Yan: she was just calling to tell us that she missed her flight 
Michael Lu: hehee 
William Yan: but for a jock that meant living without said phone for a day aka close to death It somehow managed to be a Shakespearean sonnet with an extra stanza 
Michael Lu: lel 
William Yan: hue time to do analysis apparently I need a reason for making the poem Time to bs 
Michael Lu: have fun 
William Yan: wait what was your reason for making the poem "What do you want the reader to think, feel, do or understand as a result of reading your poem?" 
Michael Lu: make reader see llama in new way such BS 
William Yan: ... Because llamas can fly and descend from heavens 
Michael Lu: shhh

Michael Lu: I did But we should briefly study each otherâs topics next week And do a lot more practice test tests Topics meaning concept 
William Yan: yea I'm available all next week skipping thursday math team 
Michael Lu: Cool I have track So how long will you be staying? 
William Yan: as long as needed 
Michael Lu: Okay then can I come after track? 
William Yan: when's that if it's absurdly late I've ntohign to do before you arrive 
Michael Lu: Study for mat sci or do hw I can get back around 4:45 at worst 5:20 
William Yan: that's fine then I have teo take alte bus home tho 
Michael Lu: Get good note on those Like wikipedia level specifics 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Do you wanna take an Astro test at Sb Later ? Like 4 or 5? 
William Yan: Maybe If it stops snowing probably not skip track tomorrow and we can do more... 
Michael Lu: Get a ride 
William Yan: My dad doesn't want to drive Just skip track 
Michael Lu: Ask Ethan 
William Yan: I'm not going out today If you really wanted to practice you shouldn't have put track over scioly 
Michael Lu: Yes But the reason u donât want to practice Is because you donât want to go outside 
William Yan: I'm not walking to starbucks in a snowstorm have your dad drive me then yes 
Michael Lu: Iâm asking Ethan 
William Yan: also you're printing out the test my home printer is shit 
Michael Lu: Iâm at Sb already bud What do you mean your printer is bad? If we canât weâll just use iPad 
William Yan: tell me what ethan says I need a ride there and back 
Michael Lu: Ah forget about it Stay at home Ethan canât drive 
William Yan: is ethan with you ? 
Michael Lu: No Heâs walking to sb 
William Yan: good for him I can skype at around 8 if you really want 
Michael Lu: Nah Just do whatever on your own Weâll work something out tmrw Make sure u make notes on those degenerate stars 
William Yan: i am you got a few variable questions wrong, tomorrow I'll give you the test and you can correct stuff finished degen stars gonna do binaries tomorrow doc is in granddaddy 
Michael Lu: Aight cool How fast can u get to Scioly tmrw Iâll try to squeeze in a test before I go to track 
William Yan: Just skip... What's so important about track 
Michael Lu: Exercise and keeping good terms with Reader Sorry for making u wait the other days So Iâll do a test tmrw earlier

William Yan: You email a professor and they say yes 
Michael Lu: Who did u email 
William Yan: A lot of people Why? 
Michael Lu: And like, what warrants an acceptance 
William Yan: They say you can work in their lab over the summer Itâs not that official 
Michael Lu: I see And then submit the project to competitions? 
William Yan: Yea why the sudden interest in research though 
Michael Lu: Because Iâm going to stony brook to research And then stalk you And then win Siemens nationals And then go to Haaavaaaaaad

Michael Lu: Nope Iâm just curious lol 
William Yan: ah ok 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Was that correct? 
William Yan: no cylinder 
Michael Lu: Lol actually 
William Yan: they propegate away from the string at the same time and speed it's like dropping a pebble into water 
Michael Lu: Did u put cylinder 
William Yan: ... boi 
Michael Lu: Umm pebble in water? Wait is it actually cylinder 
William Yan: yes waves propogate out from teh rope how tf is it gonna make a cylinder i mean sphere* 
Michael Lu: In 2D Itâs a circle How does it translate into a cylinder in 3D I canât quite visualize that intuitively 
William Yan: it's a strong string the center of the circle extends through the page so the circle follows it 
Michael Lu: Like that 
William Yan: idk what the curvy line is but yea 
Michael Lu: So the waves propagate outwards from the string 
William Yan: yes 
Michael Lu: The radius of the cylinder grows 
William Yan: yes 
Michael Lu: And so does theâheightâ 
William Yan: height? 
Michael Lu: Length 
William Yan: of what 
Michael Lu: Cylinder 
William Yan: . cylinder length stays constant it matches the section of string radius increases 
Michael Lu: Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Gotcha So would area just be pi r^2 For part b Or is it surface area Of cylinder Lateral surface area 
William Yan: lateral surface area 
Michael Lu: Gotcha Thx will

Conversation:
William Yan: so uhh how does the sproket work 
Michael Lu: The chain 
William Yan: sprocket and chain yes 
Michael Lu: Is the linear movement The sprocket roared tho 
William Yan: the screw is the sprocket i presume 
Michael Lu: Yep 
William Yan: hmm so the screw is sideways and a mass pulls the chain down? 
Michael Lu: Isnât it rotational to linear 
William Yan: yes the screw screws in to push something esle 2cm that something else starts the next action gravity has to rotate the screw 
Michael Lu: Oh whoops I think I misread the step Sprocket and chain might not work 
William Yan: Oh Could just do mass hanging from a string 
Michael Lu: The screw has to be screwed out/into something I think 
William Yan: Yea The screw head can have the chain 
Michael Lu: Yea 
William Yan: Mass pulls the chain down so the screw rotated Do you know when Allisonâs back 
Michael Lu: Lol idk

Conversation:
William Yan: do you know anything about voltage amplifiers they're like transistors but the output connects back to the input for states we can use it with the IR to boost the signal also lmk if you're going to make the FA electrical or mechanically activated 
Michael Lu: Voltage amplifiers? Send link Transformers are similar but need AC Donât count on me making the entire Fa Build it mechanically and if u need electronics lmk 
William Yan: uhh why can't you I'll try but I don't think Allison's gonna be much help in building this is the link where I got it from http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/Transistor-voltage-amplifier-circuit.php I don't get it very rwell but it's something like that one I drew 
Michael Lu: Because I donât have time to build it Iâll look into voltage amp and Iâll try to build it 
William Yan: We can do that after states Regionals* If you can do t before itâs better ofc Whatâs the FA called again 
Michael Lu: Come mid February Iâll be more free 
William Yan: Wonât we all

William Yan: for astro? no 
Michael Lu: Donât forget spectra graphs for ur DSO 
William Yan: hmm 
Michael Lu: Light curves 
William Yan: starburst galaxies don't have spectra graphs it hink

Michael Lu: 1. How does the author use the development of the main character to achieve their greater purpose. Select two significant passages/parts of the work to discuss this develoment. 2. How does the author address a prevalent societal moral issue? Describe two significant passages/parts and identify/discuss around two techniques that help the author achieve this goal. Not exact but itâs the gist (espc for #2 because I responded to #1) 
William Yan: oh the 1st question ins ez thanks senior 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: R u going tmrw 
William Yan: I mean what's the point are you gonna study for astro 
Michael Lu: Yeah Iâm making new notes already man Ok if ur not willing to go then donât bother 
William Yan: lol I wouldn't have a ride anyways I'm doing galaxy formation notes 
Michael Lu: What does that mean Stick to the manual Iâll lyk what to do tmrw 
William Yan: like types of galaxies they've come up in every single test from the manual that's globular clusters, stellar populations, normal & starburst galaxies, galactic structure
and interactions 
Michael Lu: Just do stellar pop and normal and starburst for now I was doing galaxy classification which is under structure Do glob, stellar pop and starburst I got the rest covered Also what do for circuit 
William Yan: I know where to get that no need to send a picture 
Michael Lu: Ik Iâm just sayin wHaT dO I sTuDY fOr CirCuIT lAb 
William Yan: stuff from the manual 
Michael Lu: Are we doing a split 
William Yan: probably not there isn't much to study and the tests are always short so best to know everything

William Yan: don't forget circuit lab 
Michael Lu: In English, remind Deven Madan to hand in my hw to ethan Osman 
William Yan: Btw the fire drill isnât even over lol I got kicked out Tell the others I guess 
Michael Lu: What else for circuit lab 
William Yan: read the manual and do whatever u want I'll do what's missing if you can get ethan's notes we can merge ours and his 
Michael Lu: Do the history shit Lol Find the Princeton Test 
William Yan: did you check the test folder 
Michael Lu: No Do you not have it? 
William Yan: idk if I have it or not 
Michael Lu: K How hard is circuit lab Whatâs usually on test (lab and theory parts) 
William Yan: hard time generally won't be an issue Lab is usually pretty easy unless it's princeton but neither of us could use a breadboard hence you 
Michael Lu: Whatâs the lab part Task 
William Yan: how am I supposed to know 
Michael Lu: Usually 
William Yan: read the manual 
Michael Lu: What do they ask 
William Yan: it gives you examples 
Michael Lu: Manual doesnât help 
William Yan: find unknown resistance usually 
Michael Lu: You guys couldnât take measurements? 
William Yan: those ones are easy 
Michael Lu: Or you didnât know where to place the probes 
William Yan: the one lab with a breadboard we couldn't do anyways 
Michael Lu: Have they ever not used breadboard? 
William Yan: quite often usually its just sckalor circuits 
Michael Lu: Ahh got u 
William Yan: puso was like draw the Thervenin equivalent of the circuit do uk what that is 
Michael Lu: Lol no 
William Yan: rip 
Michael Lu: Have we learned it 
William Yan: in class? 
Michael Lu: Is seems familiar now that I looked it up Physics C right 
William Yan: Thervenin is basically replace all the resistors with one resistor 
Michael Lu: Yup What does the theory usually focus on 
William Yan: everything on the manual 
Michael Lu: Ik 
William Yan: it's mostly pretty good at sticking tot hat 
Michael Lu: But more specifically 
William Yan: logic gates take up the most time Op amps come up frequently 
Michael Lu: Idk how to do those yet 
William Yan: I know a bit but not enough bout them lots of history stuff 
Michael Lu: I made note on op amps 
William Yan: so i'll get the wikipedia pages for people PN semiconductors 
Michael Lu: Lol What 
William Yan: PN junction it's in chem nvm 
Michael Lu: Diode 
William Yan: yea 
Michael Lu: ? 
William Yan: hence semiconductor we should get wikipedia pages for almost everything since there's usually more than enough tiem 
Michael Lu: Wdym During the test? We should have a synthesized note section Then all the way at the back A desperate fucking Wikipedia. Conglomerate like we do for Astro Any specific questions on batteries? 
William Yan: no two copies of notes and a wikipedia hoard 
Michael Lu: Lol k 
William Yan: do u have astro done all the galaxy classifications I did everything you told me to but your part seems like a lot 
Michael Lu: I went a bit overboard I need to do gravitational waves Do we have good notes on black holes, X-ray gamma ray binary, and ULX from last year? 
William Yan: I don't think so 
Michael Lu: Do the binary shit Also put your notes in granddaddy shared folder So I can download 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Code busters test when Circuit kab* 
William Yan: tomorrow and thursday did you ask ethan yet please ask him before we practice 
Michael Lu: I did He has to find it 
William Yan: yea I don't think we're getting the notes but I think ours are good rn I'm doing x-ray gamma binaries and ULX 
Michael Lu: Iâll work on circuit lab notes tonight Are you good at doing norton and thevenin problems? 
William Yan: lol not relaly I'm not familiar with them to me it just seems like putting all the resistors into one equivalent 
Michael Lu: Ok jut wondering how good u are at doing it Also Put the calculus shit in equations Maxwells wquations Faradays law of induction 
William Yan: yea I'll do that tmw finish the magnetism part 
Michael Lu: What magnetism part 
William Yan: on the general equations doc right now it's just a copied version of inductors 
Michael Lu: Yeah general equations Basically Just put all our physics C equations Faraday law Maxwells equations 
William Yan: Thatâs what Ive been doing 
Michael Lu: Lmk When u print shit An emergency came up when I got home So I wasnât able to do jack shit Sry 
William Yan: Itâs fine We can print at school 
Michael Lu: Will do tonight 
William Yan: How will you print it Save Astro for tonight

Xiaoyang Luo: Litty Did u finish coding the merge method 
Michael Lu: yea 
Xiaoyang Luo: How many lines it actually is 
Michael Lu: 23 for me 
Xiaoyang Luo: My lengthy version doesn't work the way it should 77 Gg 
Michael Lu: gg 
Xiaoyang Luo: I have a 23 version too but it doesn't do anything to the array 
Michael Lu: you need to copy temp values into array at the end of the merge method 
Xiaoyang Luo: I did K I least I figured this could be accomplished within 23 lines Thx

Michael Lu: hello elissa. I am that one freshman child that was with abe on that one day in that one library in the school last year. I looked at the chem notes for scioly when you derive the bcc cell formula, you wrote r = r + r = a^2 + 2a^2b^2 = 3a^2 I am a sophomore, so I don't know a lot. I don't get r = r + r and when you say a^2 + 2a^2b^2 = 3a^2 do you mean a^2 + 2a^2 = b^2, which means 3a^2 = b^2? pls halp i cannot into chemistry. 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: also how do you find the atomic radius of atoms that compose a crystal given the unit cell type of the crystal and the density of the solid halp 
Yiqing He: Hello r = r + r was a typo, thanks for telling me It should be b^2 = a^2 + f^2 In the diagram, b, a and f form a right triangle with b as the hypotenuse Sorry about that 
Michael Lu: k 
Yiqing He: And so b^2 = 3a^2 For the radius problem, it's the same method as the example for finding density Except, density is known and you have to find  radius 
Michael Lu: how would you get the mass tho 
Yiqing He: You can do this by subbing into the equation for density 
Michael Lu: molar mass? 
Yiqing He: Oops, molar mass should also be known Fixing that right now By those two things in the list, I basically just meant you should know how to use the density equations 
Michael Lu: okee 
Yiqing He: No problem Good luck 
Michael Lu: thx 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: lol ended up guessing on a lot of the chem questions... XD 
Yiqing He: lol sry i hope you were at least entertained 
Michael Lu: Lol maybe ó¾° 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: From ISLIP 
Yiqing He: sad reacts 
Michael Lu: any tips on how to get those points? 
Yiqing He: we add a specific screen for the science info just write it out in text 
Michael Lu: Ohhh Lol I think I wrote them all as comments 
Yiqing He: in the main menu we had a button that said "science" you could integrate it into the game too 
Michael Lu: How did they score ur science in ur Tesla game? 
Yiqing He: I don't remember I'll ask Justin 
Michael Lu: But all the science explanations were explicitly in the game, right? 
Yiqing He: I think so And also random factoids are good 
Michael Lu: Do all the science concepts have to be like super relevant to the theme? Like I usually have a general science concept for jumping/sliding every game, can that be used even if itâs not relevant to the theme? 
Yiqing He: it does have to be specific to the theme 
Michael Lu: Darn Did u guys usually hit 4? 
Yiqing He: i think so i mean...if you have a rationale for what's happening in the game then it's not Extremely hard to think of it? you just need to break down your explanation into four facts 
Michael Lu: Ok ð 
Yiqing He: good luck with this hell event 
Michael Lu: Lol ð Thx 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Yuheeee Do you have a Graham writing conference Tuesday after school. 
Yuhan Liu: Oh yes I do We r doubling 
Michael Lu: Aight Yah U have v-ball practice? R u going first? 
Yuhan Liu: I have a game at 5 U can go first if u need Iâm ok with either 
Michael Lu: K thx, I have track practice so that'd be nice :) 
Yuhan Liu: Ok cool 


Conversation:
Yuhan Liu: Can u text me when ur done with ur writing conference 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Where do you live? 
Yuhan Liu: 4619 Arcadia Lane 
Michael Lu: K thx We are here 
Yuhan Liu: Okk coming 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Yuhee Download the folder I shared with you on google drive (Schlit Astro 2k18) eventually. 
Yuhan Liu: Just download? 
Michael Lu: U wonât have internet there 
Yuhan Liu: Oh I see ok 
Michael Lu: So yah download and make sure u can view the docs, PDFs, or ops 
Yuhan Liu: Oh wait we can use our computer right 
Michael Lu: Ppt* Yeah Two laptops per team 
Yuhan Liu: Oh can I just download Wikipedia or something 
Michael Lu: Yeah thatâs already one of the files U can download more too 
Yuhan Liu: Oh LOL 
Michael Lu: ;) 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Yuhee How worth is doubling physics? 
Yuhan Liu: I think itâs better to take bio and physics Or something else 
Michael Lu: Y 
Yuhan Liu: Itâs just that for me bio conflicted so I couldnât take physics C and Bio at the same time So I opted for physics 2 and physics Cuz even tho there r different topics Thereâs a lot of overlap 
Michael Lu: Electricity? 
Yuhan Liu: And magnetism About 3 months worth is repeated 
Michael Lu: Howâs the workload/tests? 
Yuhan Liu: Thatâs pretty manageable Thereâs barely any homework 
Michael Lu: How much hw in total? 
Yuhan Liu: Itâs very manageable Like 
Michael Lu: Webassign? 
Yuhan Liu: On average 1 webassign per class per week So 15 questions per week? Sometimes u have weeks of no hw Sometimes u have 20 questions due in a week So I guess on average Itâs like 15 per week If u donât procrastinate Itâs even less 
Michael Lu: Who did u have for physics 1? 
Yuhan Liu: Sckalor 
Michael Lu: K Lol so if thereâs overlap Can you like Not pay attention in II 
Yuhan Liu: Yeah 
Michael Lu: did you? 
Yuhan Liu: I just did college apps in physics 2 
Michael Lu: Lmao 
Yuhan Liu: Cuz I have it after C And C does E/M before physics 2 If it was the other way around If physics 2 did E/M first Then Iâd suggest paying attention in physics C 
Michael Lu: What does II start with 
Yuhan Liu: Fluids And then they do thermo And then E/M And then waves and optics 
Michael Lu: Schlit 
Yuhan Liu: For physics C u start with a bit of mechanics and then dive right into E/M so theyâre ahead with the E/M stuff 
Michael Lu: Do u do maxwells crap 
Yuhan Liu: in physcis C yes in physics 2 wells just brushes over them but no claculus 
Michael Lu: Lol Cool beans ð¥ð¥ð¥thx man 
Yuhan Liu: lol np 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Yuhan help me with NHD we are getting slaughtered 
Yuhan Liu: Lol Im probably not the right guy 
Michael Lu: lol how far did u guys get Website? 
Yuhan Liu: Didnât make it anywhere Yah Website 
Michael Lu: Was your project good? 
Yuhan Liu: They like it when you code stuff Lol. Nope 
Michael Lu: Interview? 
Yuhan Liu: No Well There were questikns that they ask But we didnât have am interview You donât need one if you cant get one 
Michael Lu: K 
Yuhan Liu: Mhm Good luck lol 
Michael Lu: Like what did you get cuckrd for From judges 
Yuhan Liu: Tbh no idea 
Michael Lu: Donât they have a rubric? 
Yuhan Liu: Yeah I thought we did fine I think it wasnât that structured And organized They had a hard time following 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Iâm missing out help Scioly Astro is fake 
Yuhan Liu: Use mv^2/r to find velocity And then use 2*pi*r/v to find period 
Michael Lu: Centripetal = Fg ? 
Yuhan Liu: Yeah whatâs fg Gmm/r^2 Ya So v^2/r=GM/r^2 M is mass of earth 
Michael Lu: Same answer 
Yuhan Liu: Uhh Hold on Iâm outside rn so I canât do the problem but like Did u get v correct at least 
Michael Lu: No but it matches yahoo answers 
Yuhan Liu: Oh what Lmao 
Michael Lu: Like everything basically matched yahoo answers 
Yuhan Liu: Oh Thatâs weird Maybe try using different sigfigs 
Michael Lu: K 
Yuhan Liu: I remember there was a question that wells gave us And
He copied the answer wrong 
Michael Lu: Lol 
Yuhan Liu: Lol so maybe thatâs what happened 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Yo FaceTime me so I can say hi to Wells? 
Yuhan Liu: Iâm not on physics 2 yet lol 
Michael Lu: When u do 
Yuhan Liu: Oh uh Do I have to 
Michael Lu: Lol no 
Yuhan Liu: Loll NEVESSS 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: How do Wells is dubbing me 
Yuhan Liu: Holy this is so long ago Wat the duck is this Ok uh 
Michael Lu: Fluid dynamics 
Yuhan Liu: Use that bernoulli equation Rho*g*h =1/2rho*v^2+some shit like that U just gotta find the flow rate pretty much 
Michael Lu: Cool Itâs given. Xd 
Yuhan Liu: Oh what Just use A*v=flow rate 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Yuhan hi 
Yuhan Liu: Hi 
Michael Lu: Do u have Tips for common app essay writing Like topics or stule Style* 
Yuhan Liu: My common app was really bad lmao but I guess keep things casual 
Michael Lu: What did u write abt 
Yuhan Liu: Almost like ur talking voice I wrote ab taking unconventional paths to solve problems And my experiences with that 
Michael Lu: What problem 
Yuhan Liu: Like problems in general 
Michael Lu: Ahh I c 
Yuhan Liu: Yeah but I guess in general just keep things casual Donât make it too formal 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Yuheee Just wonderin Whatâs ur candid take on the college political game Like affirmative action, gender balance in STEM, major quotas, geographical represent, etc. And tips on dealing with it? 
Yuhan Liu: Umm idk I donât have much of a stance on it Most colleges r pretty diverse in that sense so you donât have to worry ab it much Like youâll always find a group of people with similar interests 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Gausssss law Hlp 
Yuhan Liu: Use a cylinder centered at the rod as ur Gaussian surface Radius of that cylinder is 8 cm 


Conversation:
Yuhan Liu: For above and below use a rectangular prism Gaussian surface Or a cylinder And same for inside actually lol Just make the bases of the prism perpendicular to the xy plane And the lateral sides will have an E field of 0 So u only have to calculate the E field through the bases of the prism 
Michael Lu: Rectangular prism surface Surface area or area of the top face? 
Yuhan Liu: Area of the bases 
Michael Lu: So twice xy 
Yuhan Liu: Yeah Iâm Yeah* 
Michael Lu: Qot 
Yuhan Liu: Wait whatâs x and y 
Michael Lu: âLength and widthâ Of inifinith Idk it was wrong anyways 
Yuhan Liu: Wait wat is that equation lmao U have E*2xy = charge encloses 
Michael Lu: pV 
Yuhan Liu: Which is x*y*a*p 
Michael Lu: yeah 
Yuhan Liu: Try getting rid of the 2 in the denominator 
Michael Lu: I tried that already Is fail 
Yuhan Liu: Try uh Putting a 4? 
Michael Lu: :o 
Yuhan Liu: Did that work 
Michael Lu: Whyb4 
Yuhan Liu: Wait did it work 
Michael Lu: What does 4 do 
Yuhan Liu: Ok so basically I never fully understood this despite Sckalor explaining it twice to me But when u have a non conducting object the charge will spread out in like one thin line or something Well not spread out but like Distribute in a thin line Making it so u have to divide by 2 Or something like that But like did it work tho OH u kno why Okok Take ur Gaussian surface 
Michael Lu: Yeah 
Yuhan Liu: But have the bottom face be in the object Like have the bottom face be on the xy-plane at z=0 So it encloses only have the charge Half the charge* And then u only need to compute the area for 1 face 
Michael Lu: Then Would it just be pa/2e 
Yuhan Liu: Wait Yeah jk Hmm ð¤ ð§ ð¤ð§ Idk man This is a weird ass question 
Michael Lu: Agree 
Yuhan Liu: Did 4 not work 
Michael Lu: Is above = below? 
Yuhan Liu: Yea 
Michael Lu: Okay will try 
Yuhan Liu: Wait Actually nvm U do u L o l 
Michael Lu: Lol aight Iâll come back to it 
Yuhan Liu: Wait r h typing e_0 correctly 
Michael Lu: E sub 
Yuhan Liu: Make sure ur typing the stuff right Like make sure there isnât already a built in symbol for that 
Michael Lu: Nah e sub 0 worked before Epsilon 
Yuhan Liu: Oh okok Cuz this one time I typed out theta of something and u have to use like some other theta looking variable Got 2 questions wrong cuz of that 
Michael Lu: Oof 


Conversation:
Michael Lu: Yuheeeeeeee What did u say For why Comp Sci was ur major And Econ as minor 
Yuhan Liu: I donât have Econ as a minor I put entrepreneurship 
Michael Lu: When u applied Ah 
Yuhan Liu: Cuz I ljke to apply abstract reasoning from math to more concrete things And CS was perfect for that Like that was the skeleton 
Michael Lu: Si seÃ±or What abt entrepreneursip 
Yuhan Liu: That was the concrete thing part Like to make stuff To make products 
Michael Lu: Oh like math -> CS -> entrepreneurship 
Yuhan Liu: And apply the abstract thinking to real world solutions Yeah 
Michael Lu: Jajajajajajaja R u visiting tmrw? 
Yuhan Liu: At 3:40 yea 
Michael Lu: Yay Aww youâll miss visiting wells during physics II 
Yuhan Liu: Yeah ð I might visit Monday 
Michael Lu: Too many kids doubling 
Yuhan Liu: Lmao I started a movement 
Michael Lu: Lol then you put a dent in two studentâs GPAs A big dent 
Yuhan Liu: Wdym dent 
Michael Lu: C-size dent 
Yuhan Liu: R they failing LOOOL They canât be like me Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯ They can try but Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯ 
Michael Lu: Lolllll yuhÃ© 
Yuhan Liu: Lmao 
Michael Lu: Lol hopefully will catch u tmrw (if rEaDEr sets me free) 
Yuhan Liu: Yeah Iâll stay from 3:40 to whenever Chill with spinelli lmao Wit scioly 
Michael Lu: Yuhhh 
Yuhan Liu: What time is wells physics In case I visit moneday Monday 
Michael Lu: 5th period like 11:00 basically 
Yuhan Liu: If I wake up on time I shall visit 
Michael Lu: Cali tmezone 
Yuhan Liu: Lmao 3 hours behind
